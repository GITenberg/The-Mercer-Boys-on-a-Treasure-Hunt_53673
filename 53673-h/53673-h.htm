<h1 title="">THE MERCER BOYS ON A
<br />TREASURE HUNT</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">THE PROFESSOR&rsquo;S LETTER</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have a crack at that ball,&rdquo; said Don
Mercer, with a grin.</p>
<p>His brother Jim returned the grin as he said:
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out on the field and ask the kids to toss us
one. They won&rsquo;t mind giving us one swing at it.&rdquo;
The two Mercer brothers were standing at the edge
of a large vacant lot near the center of their home
town one morning late in June. They had been
home from Woodcrest Military Institute for a week
now on their summer vacation, and this particular
day, having nothing more exciting to do, they had
wandered around the town, coming at length to a
familiar field where they had often played baseball.
A number of youngsters were on the ground now,
tossing and batting a discolored baseball, and the
sight of them had caused the sandy haired, slightly
freckled Don to express his wish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>The two boys walked across the field toward the
boys and Don said: &ldquo;Wonder how much further
I can hit it now than I could when I played here as
a kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to tell,&rdquo; returned Jim. &ldquo;But we certainly
got quite a bit of practise this spring at Woodcrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small boys looked at them as they drew
nearer, but as the Mercer boys were well known the
boys felt no alarm or resentment at the approach of
the larger lads. Don walked over to the boy who
held the bat and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about giving me one crack at the ball,
Charlie?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The boy smiled and extended the bat, a bit of
embarrassment in his look. &ldquo;Sure, Don. Take a
couple of them,&rdquo; he invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess one will be enough,&rdquo; remarked Don, as
he turned to face a boy who held the ball. &ldquo;Put a
good one over, Tommy, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy addressed as Tommy grinned boyishly
and turned to the youngsters who stood far afield,
waiting for flies to be batted to them. &ldquo;Get way
out, you fellows,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;This fellow can hit
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>The two fielders backed away and Tommy threw a
fast ball to Don. The latter easily batted it out and
one of the youngsters caught it triumphantly. Don
handed the bat to Jim, who in turn cracked the ball
out along the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one more, fellows,&rdquo; begged Don, taking the
bat from his brother&rsquo;s hand. When the ball had been
turned over to young Tommy he wound his arm
up slowly and then pitched it with considerable force
in Don&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit that!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>It was traveling on a straight line and Don swung
the bat around sharply. There was a singing crack
as the wood met the ball, and the muddy spheroid
sailed in a mounting curve up into the air. It passed
high above the fielder&rsquo;s head and made its way
straight for the side window of a small house that
stood on the edge of the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, boy!&rdquo; shouted Jim. &ldquo;Right through the
window!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His statement was correct. With a disconcerting
crash the ball smashed the window to pieces.</p>
<p>Don dropped the bat and shoved his hands into
his pocket. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;How is that for bad luck? Right through Professor
Scott&rsquo;s window!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the professor wasn&rsquo;t at home, and in that
room,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;Guess we had better go over and
see about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; nodded Don. &ldquo;Thanks for the
hits, kids. Come on, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the boys to gather and talk things over
in awed tones the two Mercer brothers made their
way across the field in the direction of Professor
Scott&rsquo;s house. The gentleman mentioned had been
their history teacher while they were in grammar
school, and they knew him quite well, so they had
no great fears as to the outcome. No one had appeared
at the window or at the doors, and Jim supposed
that the professor was not at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; Don returned, &ldquo;or he would surely
have appeared by now. But we&rsquo;ll go over and see,
and if he isn&rsquo;t we&rsquo;ll leave a note and tell him who did
it, and offer to pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Mercer boys are making their way
across the field something may be said as to who they
were. Both boys, fine, manly chaps, were the sons
of a wealthy lumber man of Bridgewater, Maine.
They had lived the life of healthy young men whose
interests were centered in worthwhile things. Of late
they had had some adventurous events in their lives,
some of which were related in the first volume of
this series, <span class="sc">The Mercer Boys&rsquo; Cruise in the
Lassie</span>, when they ran down a marine bandit gang,
and later when solving a baffling mystery at the
military school, details of which were related in the
second volume entitled <span class="sc">The Mercer Boys at
Woodcrest</span>. Together with their comrade, Terry
Mackson, they had faced many perils and adventures,
and now they were home to spend, as they thought,
a comparatively dull vacation. Just how deeply mistaken
they were in their thought will be found later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>They entered the front yard of Professor Scott&rsquo;s
house and walked around to the side, where the
broken window faced toward the empty lot. There
appeared to be no one at home, but when they came
opposite to the window Don raised himself slightly
on his toes and looked in. Then he dropped down
again and looked at Jim in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The professor is at home,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sitting there, reading a letter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reading a letter?&rdquo; asked Jim, amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered his brother. &ldquo;Look in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim raised himself and looked in the window. A
tall man with bushy white hair and a thick iron gray
beard was seated at the desk in what appeared to be
a study, busily engaged in reading a letter. Near him,
almost at his feet, lay the boys&rsquo; ball, and fragments
of broken glass littered the floor. The professor was
apparently deeply absorbed in his letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you know about that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jim, softly. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t even seem to know that the
window is broken! We always knew that he was
somewhat absent-minded, but I thought he was more
responsible than that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Before Don could reply there was a stir in the
room and the next minute the professor came to the
window and looked down at them. He still held
what appeared to be a lengthy letter in his hand, and
he recognized them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Don and Jim Mercer!&rdquo; he cried, showing
strong white teeth in an engaging smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
to see you home again. Did you come to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to apologize for breaking your window,
and to offer to pay for it, Professor Scott,&rdquo; answered
Don. &ldquo;I was batting out the ball for some boys,
and I hit it harder than I expected to. I hope it
didn&rsquo;t startle you very much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I jumped a little bit,&rdquo; admitted the professor. &ldquo;I
did notice it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice it!&rdquo; exploded Jim. &ldquo;I should think that
you might have! It certainly made enough noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did make some. I felt that it was some of the
boys playing ball and I was going to throw the ball
back to them in a minute.&rdquo; He picked the ball up and
handed it to Don. &ldquo;Throw it back, and then come
inside, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don threw the ball back to the small boys, who
were watching from the field. &ldquo;Are you sure we
won&rsquo;t be breaking in on you, professor?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as much as you did a few minutes ago!&rdquo;
smiled the teacher. &ldquo;Come around through the back
way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>When the boys entered the professor&rsquo;s study he
motioned them to chairs and asked them a few questions
about their school life and studies. All the
time he held the letter in his hand, and when he had
finished talking about their school he took the lead
in the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you boys wonder what is so interesting in
this letter that I hardly noticed a ball when it broke
through my window,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Well, I remember
how interested you boys were in history while in my
classes, and I&rsquo;m glad you came along when you did.
This letter is from my son Ned, who lives in Lower
California, and it contains one of the most fascinating
stories I ever came across!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing as they did the professor&rsquo;s deep interest
in historic and scientific studies and discoveries the
boys found themselves interested at once. The
teacher went on, after a glance at the letter, &ldquo;Ned
owns a small farm or homestead in Lower California
near the mines at San Antonio and Triunfo, where
he tests the ores and carries on general scientific
studies. He tells me that the ores are refractory and
not easy to test, but he enjoys the work and is devoting
his whole life to it. I don&rsquo;t think he is quite
as much interested in historic things as I am, but
knowing how eager I am for relics and information
of the past, he has sent me this remarkable piece of
news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some time ago, a steam trawler, while fishing in
130 fathoms of water, hauled up a piece of wreckage
in its net. Upon examination it appeared to be the
bulwark of an ancient Spanish galleon, with parts of
the rigging attached. On the sides, plainly distinguishable,
were designs in hand-sewn leather. Some
of those big, lumbering ships were decorated quite
extensively, you know, and this one was distinguished
by its hand-sewn leather covering. It was
evident that somewhere in the neighborhood a Spanish
galleon had gone to the bottom, and it is always
a safe conclusion that where there is galleon there
is also a treasure. Those ships carried gold, silver
and jewels from Old Mexico and Peru to Spain, and
this particular ship may have been going home after
a trip up the coast of California. That was the type
of ship that the brave English seamen of Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s time whipped so soundly at the time of
the Spanish Armada, and there were hundreds of
them in service along the shores of the Americas and
the Islands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;The spot was marked in the hope that treasure
would be discovered, on the presumption that it was
a treasure ship, and shortly afterward active operations
were started by a California diving company.
But although they searched the shore under water
in minute detail they found nothing. The mystery
is not that they didn&rsquo;t find any treasure, but that they
didn&rsquo;t find any more of the ship. You might think
that perhaps that particular piece had been washed
there from some point further out, and it is possible,
but the piece, when netted, had been buried in the
mud, and it looks as though it had been there for
centuries, though ships haven&rsquo;t a habit of sinking in
sections, one part at one place and another part in
a different place. However, they didn&rsquo;t find a thing,
and at last the whole undertaking was given up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is too bad,&rdquo; said Jim, who was deeply absorbed
in the story. &ldquo;So it was a false hope from
the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long ago was that?&rdquo; asked Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a little over a year ago,&rdquo; answered the
professor. &ldquo;And that leads me to the second part
of my story. Ned had given up all interest in it
even before the diving and salvage company had, and
he thought no more about it. The piece of wreckage
is a treasure in itself and was sent up to San Francisco,
where it was subsequently placed in a museum.
Realizing that I would be interested in it all he first
wrote to me at the time it happened, and I read it and
wrote for news, but as the thing died down I forgot
it, too. I have planned to run out to San Francisco
sometime and see the part myself, and I intend
doing so soon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ned told me at the time that there had been some
slight changes in the coast line during the last few
centuries. A number of creeks that formerly ran
into the ocean have closed up and disappeared, some
of them filled with shifting sand and soil. I don&rsquo;t
know if you were ever aware of the fact or not, but
although Lower California has a dry climate and is
mostly barren, there are spots where it is tropical
and jungle plants and trees grow there in luxurious
profusion. Although they have almost no rain, they
do have violent storms, and at such times are treated
to regular cloudbursts. At those periods the elements
raise the old dickens and it was during these spells
that some creeks and small rivers closed up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you wonder why I&rsquo;m particular to tell you
all this. I do so because I believe it has a direct bearing
on the most amazing part of Ned&rsquo;s letter. I believe
it explains the disappearance of the Phantom
Galleon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Phantom Galleon!&rdquo; cried Don, while Jim
stirred in eager interest. &ldquo;What is that, Professor
Scott?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">THE STORY OF THE PHANTOM GALLEON</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered the professor, slowly. &ldquo;Up
until a very short time Ned, and others, thought that it
was only a legend. He hadn&rsquo;t been in the country
very long before he heard it, and he put it down as
one of those semi-historic tales that consist of half
truth and half fancy. The tale had been handed
down for centuries and always by word of mouth,
and this is the story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a certain evening, hundreds of years ago, a
huge, lumbering Spanish galleon, loaded with treasure,
fled along the coast of Lower California, pursued
by three English barks. In the long run there
was not a chance that the gold ship would get away,
for the light English barks were much faster, and
it was only a question of time before they hauled
down on her and boarded. The way they were
situated was this: one ship was in the rear of the
Spaniard, one was coming up in front of it, and a
third was moving in from the open sea. It was
a regular trap, you see, and merely a matter of
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;But fortunately&mdash;or unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t know
which&mdash;for the galleon, one of those rare tropical
storms came up at that moment when capture seemed
assured for the gold ship. There was a furious rush
of the wind, the sky grew black and lowering, and
finally, in one great maelstrom of confusion the three
ships and the galleon were blotted out of sight. The
storm only lasted for some half hour, which is unusually
long for some of them, and when it lifted
the galleon was nowhere to be seen. The English
barks had had all they could handle and had been
so busy holding their own against the elements that
they hadn&rsquo;t time to keep up the pursuit, and their
conclusion was that the Spaniard had gone to the
bottom of the sea. As it was built much higher
and was much harder to handle than the lighter
ships, the conclusion was justified, and the pursuers
drew off and left the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;As I told you, that had happened in the evening,
just as dusk was coming down over the shore
and the sea, and the high decked galleon, with its
spread of strained canvas and yellow streamers, its
lofty rigging and its ornamental work, looked like
some strange phantom as it fled down the coast.
I don&rsquo;t know who saw it or how many saw it, but
to this day the story, half legend as it is, has persisted
concerning the phantom galleon. Some fantastic
tales still linger about it appearing on dusky
nights and sailing swiftly along the shore, but they
are idle stories to which no one with intelligence
pays any attention. Ned never gave the whole thing
much credit until a remarkable circumstance brought
it forcefully to his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near his little ranch there is a large old estate
which belongs to a once noble family of mixed
Spanish and Mexican blood, and although they keep
pretty much to themselves, out of a lofty sense of
pride, they have been rather friendly to Ned, in
their stately and exacting way. There was an old
man who was head of the place, his daughter, and
one or two servants. Lately the old gentleman
died, and Ned kindly helped out with the funeral
and the management of the ranch affairs until a
permanent overseer was brought over from Mexico,
and in her gratitude the young senorita allowed him
to roam pretty much around the house. I suspect
from his letter that he has of late become rather
more than friendly with the young lady, but that
doesn&rsquo;t make much difference either way. It seems
that she had been left with quite a library, reading
being an important business in such a lonely place,
and some of the volumes were pretty precious, being
hand written works of early settlers and priests,
who thus left interesting historic records. One of
these books attracted Ned&rsquo;s attention strongly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;It had been written by a priest in the year 1571,
and it described the Spanish treasure hunts, some
of which were plain plundering expeditions, and this
particular book related them in detail. Ned wasn&rsquo;t
unusually interested until he came across the part
relating to a chase that the galleon had had from
three English ships. According to the author they
had loaded with something like 100,000 pesos and
a fortune in gold and silver bars, to say nothing
of jewels, and had sailed for Upper California. But
near the shores of Lower California the galleon had
been sighted by an English bark, which had instantly
given chase. The galleon, which had a good
start, fled, but its chances of escape suddenly became
less as another English ship appeared before
it, and another bore down on it from the open sea.
It was growing dark, wrote the priest, and there
was some hope that it would slip away in the darkness,
but something more to the point stepped in
when a tropical storm wrapped the nearby world
in temporary darkness. The <i>Don Fernando</i>, that was
the name of the galleon, slipped into a nearby creek
or small river and ran hard and fast aground, the
lofty masts and spars crashing down, a total ruin.
The creek seems to have been far enough back for
the wreck to have escaped the notice of the English,
for they were not molested, and the crew, after
assuring themselves that the treasure was safe, tried
to make their way inland for help.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;But somehow or other&mdash;the writer does not say
how&mdash;they all perished, and he alone escaped to
Mexico, there to write down the story of the flight
of the galleon. He affirms positively in his journal
that the treasure was not touched, and he planned
to raise enough men to go and get it. Whether he
did or not no one knows, but if he didn&rsquo;t that treasure
is still somewhere in a creek, in the wreck of that
galleon, perhaps buried below the level of the sand
which has shifted. Ned thinks that it is nearby and
that is why he has written to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tragedy of the thing is this: the priest wrote
everything except the name of the creek down which
the phantom galleon fled. There are several pages
missing from his book, and it breaks off like this:
&lsquo;The ship with its fortune in gold and precious
stones, its coin and bars, is still buried in the sand
in a creek called&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; and there it unfortunately
ends. If the name was only there we could tell
something, for it is always probable that someone
can be found who will recall the name, no matter
how ancient it may be, but as the name is lost,
Ned faces a blank wall. He inquired from Senorita
Mercedes just where she had obtained that book,
but she knew nothing outside of the fact that it
had apparently always been in their house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly is interesting,&rdquo; said Don, as the
professor stopped. &ldquo;Your son Ned thinks that it is
somewhere near his place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he believes it is somewhere within a radius
of a hundred miles. The legend has it that the
galleon vanished somewhere right on that very
shore, and that would indicate that the galleon ran
up some creek very near to his place. If no one
ever did get back and take that treasure it is probably
in the rotted hold of the treasure ship, buried more
or less deeply in the sand, just waiting for some
lucky one to discover it. Much of the land near
Ned&rsquo;s ranch has never been thoroughly explored,
and it may be that it is nearer to him than he has
any idea of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he made any effort to find it?&rdquo; inquired
Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A somewhat feeble one, yes. He endeavored to
enlist the aid of some nearby ranch men, some half
breed Mexicans, but although they started with some
enthusiasm they soon gave it up. They are the kind
who would not mind sharing in the rewards if someone
else does the work. So he gave it up, except
that he patiently read every other book in Senorita
Mercedes&rsquo; library in the hope of obtaining some clue,
but the missing pages were not to be located and he
is still no nearer to finding out the name of that
creek than he was at first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;And he never did find out how that book came to
be in the library of the Spanish ranch?&rdquo; asked
Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but we can hazard a guess as to that. The
Mercedes family have lived in Lower California for
at least a hundred years, but before that they came
from Mexico. It is very possible that the priest
had escaped to Mexico and fallen in some way in
with this ancient Spanish family, perhaps dying
there and leaving the book with them. How the
last few leaves of the book came to be missing no
one knows. But perhaps you can see the possibilities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that perhaps someone has already read
that book, tore out the sheets with the information
on them, and has already found that treasure!&rdquo; was
the startling answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">A ROYAL INVITATION</span></h2>
<p>They were somewhat dismayed at the professor&rsquo;s
reasoning but at length Don shook his head. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see that it is necessarily so,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Of
course, there is a big chance that such is the reason,
but on the other hand it may simply be that the pages
have been lost. It can be taken both ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded the professor. &ldquo;It can. That is
why I would never allow myself any false hopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are going out and help Ned look for
this treasure?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out more because he wants me to
come than for anything else,&rdquo; said Professor Scott.
&ldquo;And as much for the change as for anything else.
I&rsquo;ve been studying pretty hard of late, and I&rsquo;m sure
a change of air and scenery wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me a
bit. I haven&rsquo;t any idea that Ned will ever find that
legendary treasure, but the fact that he found evidence
that the story of the phantom galleon is true
interested me greatly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you do go out there you will look around
for it, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; inquired Don.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Ned will see to that! He has the idea
that he will run across it, and nothing stops him
once he gets an idea. I&rsquo;ll join in with him and do
some tramping around, but while he&rsquo;ll be looking for
gold I&rsquo;ll be looking for health. I&rsquo;m rather more
sure of finding what I am after than he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; murmured Jim. &ldquo;It is a dandy
opportunity, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having a shot at
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys are greatly interested,&rdquo; remarked the
professor, looking at them keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we are,&rdquo; admitted Don, smiling. &ldquo;It
appeals to us, and I guess it would to any fellow.
If you go, professor, we certainly wish you all kinds
of luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said the professor. &ldquo;If you went on
such a trip, I suppose you&rsquo;d hunt the treasure with
much energy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we would,&rdquo; nodded Jim. &ldquo;If it was anywhere
near I guess we would uncover it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; the professor smiled. He was
silent a moment and then he asked: &ldquo;Now that you
boys are home for a vacation, what do you plan to
do? Have you anything definite in mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don shook his head. &ldquo;We might do a little sailing,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;We have a fine thirty-foot sloop,
and we may sail for a ways down the coast. Last
summer we did and we had a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know about that voyage,&rdquo; the professor returned.
&ldquo;That was the time you ran down those
marine bandits, wasn&rsquo;t it? I remember reading about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the time,&rdquo; Don answered. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
expect to run down any bandits this summer, but
we may take a cruise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is fine,&rdquo; said the professor, somewhat absent-mindedly.
&ldquo;So you two boys were interested in
what I told you of Ned&rsquo;s letter, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t help being,&rdquo; grinned Jim. &ldquo;I
guess every fellow is interested in treasure hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is true,&rdquo; the professor returned.
&ldquo;Well, that is the contents of the letter which made
me so interested that I paid very little attention to
the ball as it broke the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about that, professor,&rdquo; said Don.
&ldquo;How much is it, please? I&rsquo;m very anxious to have
it repaired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo; said the professor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>But Don insisted, feeling that it would not rightly
do to accept the professor&rsquo;s generous offer to put
it in himself, and at length the teacher agreed that
Don should pay for the work. He rather admired
Don&rsquo;s spirit in insisting upon paying his own way
through life, and although he knew that the Mercer
brothers had plenty of ready money he allowed Don
to pay for the broken glass more as a concession
to his spirit of the right thing to do than for any
other reason. After Don had turned over the money
to the professor the boys took their leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for that interesting story, Professor
Scott,&rdquo; said Jim, as they were leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we enjoyed it,&rdquo; added Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very welcome,&rdquo; smiled the professor.
&ldquo;I thought you would be interested, and may&mdash;be&mdash;humph,
well, let that pass for now. Good morning,
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys left the professor and walked slowly
down the shady street, discussing the letter and his
story. It appealed to them greatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sure was a strange thing, that finding of
the old book relating to the flight of the galleon,&rdquo;
mused Don. &ldquo;Looks like the hand of fate, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It surely does,&rdquo; chimed in Jim. &ldquo;Those fellows
took that treasure centuries ago, it lays buried in
the sand for years and years, and then a chance discovery
points to where it is. Sort of like a dead
man&rsquo;s finger pointing at the treasure, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhat,&rdquo; admitted Don. &ldquo;I rather feel that
if the treasure had been found by someone else Ned
Scott would not have come across that book. Now,
that is my own way of looking at it. Just as the
professor says, someone may have torn the valuable
leaves, with the location of the creek on them, out
and have found it long ago. But I somehow just
can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d surely like to be along
when Ned Scott unearths that old ship and its
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided that he does,&rdquo; smiled Don, as they
reached their home. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any guarantee that
he will. It is always possible that the whole thing
happened miles down the coast, for if I remember
correctly, from my school map, Lower California is
a mighty long stretch. Well, all I hope is that he&rsquo;ll
tell us if anything turns up. Just as soon as he
comes back, if we are home from school, we&rsquo;ll hunt
him up and ask him all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; agreed Jim. &ldquo;If he isn&rsquo;t home by the
time we are ready to return to school we can see
him during some vacation. Well, what do you say,
old man? Shall we go down and tinker with the
boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think we have time,&rdquo; decided Don, looking
at his watch. &ldquo;That visit to the professor took
up the whole morning, and mother will be waiting
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys entered the quiet but homelike little
house which was their home and prepared for dinner.
When they sat down at the table Mr. Mercer,
a kindly and energetic man, was there. He worked
in a local office, where he ran his vast lumber business,
and was generally home for meals. Margy
Mercer was also there, and the family was complete.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what have you two fellows been doing
this morning?&rdquo; asked Mr. Mercer, as he vigorously
attacked a piece of steak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;s been breaking into people&rsquo;s houses!&rdquo;
chuckled Jim. &ldquo;This was an expensive morning for
Don.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don related what had happened, and finding his
family deeply interested in the professor&rsquo;s letter,
told them the story of the phantom galleon. Mr.
Mercer smiled as he finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you two wouldn&rsquo;t mind going along
on a trip like that, would you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; exclaimed Jim. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d go
without mother&rsquo;s apple pie for a month to go on that
trip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said Mr. Mercer. &ldquo;Score one for
mother&rsquo;s pie! I imagine if anything spectacular
comes out of the professor&rsquo;s treasure hunt the newspapers
will have it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The two boys went for a brief sail in a small
catboat during the afternoon and later worked at
the bench in their boathouse, turning out the sides
for some bunks which they planned to place in their
little sleeping cottage at the end of the yard. They
already had three beds in the little place, but lately
Jim had hit upon the idea of constructing regular
ships&rsquo; bunks and they were now busy making the
pieces. They stuck to this job until the time of
the evening meal, and after that they remained at
home, listening to the radio entertainment.</p>
<p>Don, who was sitting near the living room
window, idly looking out, suddenly uttered an exclamation
and straightened up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Don?&rdquo; asked Jim, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Professor Scott!&rdquo; Don exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In here?&rdquo; demanded Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s coming up the walk.&rdquo; And Don got up
and went to the door, to open it for the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Professor Scott,&rdquo; he greeted.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; nodded the professor. &ldquo;Is your
father at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he surely is,&rdquo; said Don. &ldquo;Come right on
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He showed the professor into the living room,
where the Mercer family greeted him, and after a
few minutes of pleasant talk Mr. Mercer guided him
to his study, where they might talk in quietness and
alone. Jim looked inquiringly at Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world do you suppose he wants
with dad?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiggered if I know,&rdquo; shrugged Don.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>In less than half an hours&rsquo; time the two men returned,
both of them smiling, and Mr. Mercer turned
off the radio. Then, as they sat down the father
looked with mock sternness at his two boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want your promise to at least make an effort to
keep out of trouble while you are with Professor
Scott,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Professor Scott!&rdquo; echoed Don, while Jim
stared. &ldquo;Where are we going with Professor Scott?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out to tramp all around the sands of Lower
California, I think,&rdquo; Mr. Mercer returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; shouted Don, leaping to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Well, all right. I thought that you wanted
to go, but as long as you don&rsquo;t why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was as far as he got. &ldquo;Of course we want
to go,&rdquo; cried Jim. &ldquo;By George, this is great. What
made you decide to take us with you, professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a protective measure,&rdquo; smiled the professor,
pleased at their enthusiasm. &ldquo;I saw how interested
you boys were when I told you about it this morning,
and I was wondering if you would care to go
and if I could persuade your father to allow you
to go. You see, I want to go out there for a rest,
and I&rsquo;m afraid Ned will insist upon dragging me all
over the country in search of Spanish treasure, so
I&rsquo;m taking you boys along as buffers, to help him in
his mad adventuring.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; smiled Mrs. Mercer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let them go
if you&rsquo;ll try to keep them out of trouble, Professor
Scott. They have a very bad habit of getting into
plenty of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Ned will keep them so busy that they
won&rsquo;t have time to get into any scrapes,&rdquo; said the
professor.</p>
<p>They sat and talked for another hour, the boys
unable to believe their good fortune, the suddenness
of which had stunned them. The professor took his
leave at last, telling them that he planned to start
at the end of the coming week. After he had gone
they sat and talked some more, the boys excited at
the prospect of their coming trip.</p>
<p>When at last they went up to bed it was not to
sleep immediately. They discussed the event for
more than an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad and mother say for us to keep out of
trouble,&rdquo; chuckled Jim. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try hard to obey
orders, but I do hope we have some exciting times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry,&rdquo; chuckled Don. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
be a bit surprised if we did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys fell asleep, worn out by the events
of the day. It is doubtful if they would have slept
so peacefully had they been able to foresee the events
which loomed before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE PROFESSOR IS ATTACKED</span></h2>
<p>After three days of preparation the boys and the
professor were ready to leave for the west coast.
They were to go to San Francisco and take a steamer
there down to the settlements in Lower California.
It was a bright Saturday morning when they waved
out of the window to their friends on the station
platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Don, as the train moved out of
the station. &ldquo;We are off for new scenes at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The journey across the continent was uneventful.
They enjoyed it thoroughly, never growing tired of
the endless views which unfolded as the train sped
westward. The professor, with his varied knowledge
of places and people, his understanding of scientific
facts and his historic incidents, proved to be a most
delightful companion. In a few days they left the
train at the great city of the coast and the professor
hunted up a hotel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Professor Scott had never been to California, although
he had been in many other cities in the
United States, and his interest was as keen as that
of the boys. One of his first tasks, after they
had been installed in a good hotel, was to hasten to
the water front and inquire concerning a steamer to
take them down the coast. When he returned he reported
his findings to the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a steamer named the <i>Black Star</i> that
will take us down the day after tomorrow,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I went aboard and arranged for our passage. It
isn&rsquo;t a passenger boat, but I didn&rsquo;t have any trouble
in persuading the captain to take us as passengers.
The boat is a fruit steamer, but they have one or
two extra cabins for our use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned in early that night and the next day
took an extensive tour of the great city. A great
many of the foremost buildings and places of interest
were visited, and they obtained their longed-for
view of the piece of wreckage of the Spanish
galleon of which Ned Scott had written them. It was
a huge piece, worn by the action of the waves, with
studded leather on the sides and pieces of rigging
still clinging to it. It occupied a prominent place in
the city museum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that thing could only talk,&rdquo; the professor remarked,
as they walked around it. &ldquo;What a story it
could tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it would be very helpful to us, in our
search,&rdquo; smiled Jim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>When evening came the boys were tired, but
strange to relate, the professor was not. His interest
in places and men amounted to a passion with him,
and he loved to study them at every opportunity.
The boys were sitting around in the hotel room and
the professor, after walking around restlessly, suddenly
faced them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you boys too tired to do some more walking?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m pretty well played out,&rdquo; admitted Don.
&ldquo;But if you&rsquo;d like us to go with you, anywhere,
professor, we&rsquo;ll gladly go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied the professor, hastily. &ldquo;I just
wanted to ask you if you&rsquo;d care to take a stroll down
near the water front. There are some very quaint
places down there, and I&rsquo;d like to visit some of
them. But I don&rsquo;t want you boys to go out if you
are tired.&rdquo; He reached for his hat and went on:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down there for a stroll. I&rsquo;ll be back
shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want us&mdash;&rdquo; began Jim, but the professor
cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not at all. You boys stay here and I&rsquo;ll
wander a bit myself. See you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of yourself, professor,&rdquo; called Don,
as he went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, thanks. Don&rsquo;t worry; I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Once on the street the professor struck off for
the water front at a brisk pace. In the hotel room
Jim looked inquiringly at Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose it is alright for him to go?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; nodded Don. &ldquo;He is pretty well able
to take care of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The city was wrapped in darkness when the professor
began his wandering, a darkness which was
broken by the bright lights on the business
streets and the more feeble ones on the side streets.
The professor headed for the wharves, where the
masts of the medley of crafts could be seen rising
above the low houses which fronted the bay. Down
in this section the savant found some queer crooked
streets, lined with rows of box-like houses and cheap
eating places. Groups of men and women sat on
the doorsteps and fire escapes, children whooped and
played in the streets, and scraps of music, jarring
one on the other, came from phonographs and
radios. Sailors and business men walked back and
forth in the narrow streets, and the professor found
much to study.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>He strode along the docks, examining with interest
the multitude of ships there, ranging from huge
ocean steamers to small private boats. Liners, tramp
ships, battered steam boats, sailing vessels, schooners,
yachts, sloops, catboats, yawls and power cruisers
lay side by side with tugs and ferries. An army of
stevedores worked under blazing arc lights loading
and unloading, and the air vibrated with the rattle of
machinery, the hoarse cries of the men, and the
thump of boxes and crates. So deeply engrossed
was the professor in the scenes which he was witnessing
that he forgot the passage of time.</p>
<p>He had wandered far down the shore line when
he came at last to a street more narrow and crooked
than the rest. It was in fact nothing more than an
alley, flanked by tall seamen&rsquo;s houses, with restaurants
and pool parlors on the ground floors. The
professor looked at a sign post and saw that it was
named Mullys Slip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mullys Slip, eh?&rdquo; thought the teacher. &ldquo;This is
the quaintest of them all. I think I&rsquo;ll stroll up it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, he walked up the narrow sidewalk,
looking with interest into the stores and eating
houses as he passed by, listening to snatches of conversation
as he passed groups who sat out taking
advantage of the cool air. When he had walked to
the end of the Slip he walked back, and seeing a
well-lighted eating place near the dock, entered it
and sat down at a round table. While he ordered a
sandwich and coffee he looked around him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>It was a long, low room, the air of which was
nearly obscured by tobacco smoke, half filled at the
time with men who evidently came from the ships.
Most of them were eating, the rest were smoking
and talking, and a few slept, hanging over the tables.
The professor ate his sandwich and sipped his coffee,
content and easy in his mind, until, looking across
from him into a narrow corner, he found the eyes of
two men fixed upon him.</p>
<p>One of the men was a powerful individual with
a heavy, unhealthy looking face, whose eyes, set
close together, looked slightly crossed. The other
was tall and thin, with long and dangling arms. Both
of them were dressed in rough black clothing, which
gave no real hint as to what business they were
engaged in. They might have been sailors or stevedores,
and both showed unmistakable signs of hardy,
adventurous lives. They had evidently been talking
about the professor, for their eyes were bent on him
with earnest scrutiny, and when they observed that
he had seen them they hastily resumed their conversation.</p>
<p>The professor paid no attention to them at first,
but went on eating, looking around with keen eyes
and mentally cataloguing the men in the place. But
when he once more looked across at his neighbors
they were bending the same intent look upon him.
Vague doubt began to stir the mind of professor
Scott.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t altogether like the looks of those fellows,&rdquo;
decided the professor, as he called a waiter and paid
his small bill. &ldquo;By the way they look at me I&rsquo;d
say they were talking about me. All in all, I&rsquo;m in
a pretty rough neighborhood, and perhaps the sooner
I get out of it, the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went out of the place at once, casting a single
look back of him as he did so, and he was not made
to feel any easier as he noted that they were following
him with the same steady look. He was not
greatly alarmed, for he did not carry much money
with him, but feeling that he would be better off on
a well-lighted thoroughfare, he made his way back
along the dark street. It was now growing late and
the lights were being extinguished. He found his
road darker than it had been when he had followed
it earlier in the evening, and so he hurried on, bent
on reaching the business section.</p>
<p>He had covered two blocks when he began to
think that he was being followed. It was as much
of a feeling as an actual fact, for each time he
looked around he was unable to see anyone who
looked as though he might be trailing him. He
fancied once that he saw a shadow dart quickly
into a doorway, but though he looked keenly in
that direction he was unable to make sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph, I had better get back to the hotel,&rdquo;
mused the teacher. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m beginning to imagine
things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>On the block beyond a number of dark alleys
opened from the houses, and the professor was compelled
to pass them. Either the houses were deserted
or there was no one up at the time, for he saw no
one as he crossed the corner. Only far ahead of
him, on the opposite side of the street, a battered old
car was pulled up to the edge of an empty dock,
and a man sat looking out over the water at a group
of three-masted coal carriers.</p>
<p>Just as the professor was passing a wide alley he
thought he heard a step beside him. He turned his
head quickly, and then gasped. Two shadows seemed
to detach themselves from the passageway and bore
down on him. Before he could utter any cry a
powerful pair of arms was thrown around him and
he was strained close to the body of a big man. At
the same time, without loss of a moment, the second
man dipped his hands into the professor&rsquo;s trousers
pockets and into his inside coat pocket.</p>
<p>Taken completely by surprise the old teacher for
a second did not offer any kind of resistance and
when he did it was rather feeble, for his arms were
pinned close to his sides, and he was fairly standing
on his toes. But his feet were free, and he
managed to kick the man who held him a smart blow
in the shin. A low, growling curse was his reward,
and a blow of considerable force followed, landing
on his shoulder. By a sudden twist the professor
squirmed from the arms of the man who was holding
him, and strengthened by his indignation, which
was kindling into hot wrath, the savant punched the
second man full on the mouth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>The first man, who was none other than the narrow-eyed
individual of the restaurant growled in his
throat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bust your head, you old windjammer!&rdquo;
he roared, and swung his fist at the professor. The
blow, which landed on the teacher&rsquo;s neck, felled him
instantly to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grab him up,&rdquo; ordered the second man, stooping
over the professor, who was somewhat dazed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
dump him in the bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both men leaned down to pick up the form of the
professor when there was an interruption. The
young man who had been sitting in the nondescript
automobile had had his attention attracted by the
beginning of the struggle, and unnoticed by any of
the principals he had jumped out of the car and was
now upon them. Although he did not know one
from the other he could see that two were against
one, and noting, under the faint light from a nearby
lamp-post that the lone fighter was an elderly man,
threw himself without hesitation upon the two wharf-men.
His active fist jarred against the jaw of the
heavyset man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take that, with the compliments of the lone
star ranger!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s
all about, but that&rsquo;s my share.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>His blow infuriated the man, who drove at him
with an angry roar, but the professor was scrambling
to his feet, and the second man grasped his
leader by the arm. He spoke to him in a low tone,
and the two, with a slight hesitation, turned and
fled up the alley. Convinced that pursuit would be
useless, the young man turned to the professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, sir?&rdquo; he asked, quickly.</p>
<p>In the faint light the professor saw that he was a
boy of twenty or thereabouts, tall and somewhat
lanky, with red hair and a lean face, on which
freckles had taken up a permanent home. The professor
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks to you. Those fellows were going
to throw me into the water. Were you in that car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; grinned the boy. &ldquo;That is my private
chariot, called &lsquo;Jumpiter,&rsquo; because of its habit of doing
something very much like jumping! Have you
been robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor felt through his pockets and nodded.
&ldquo;Yes, a few dollars and a letter has been taken from
me. I don&rsquo;t care much about the money, but the
letter was from my son Ned, and I valued that
somewhat. I would like to thank you sincerely for
your timely arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; begged the young man. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
get out of here. I&rsquo;ll drive you to wherever you
want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>When they entered the battered car the professor
told the boy the name of the hotel at which he was
staying and they rolled away. Then the teacher
asked the name of his rescuer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackson is my name,&rdquo; replied the boy. &ldquo;Terry
Mackson, from Beverley, Maine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed the professor. &ldquo;I come from
Maine, too. I am a history teacher in Bridgewater!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Bridgewater!&rdquo; cried Terry as they entered the
business section. &ldquo;Then you must know the Mercer
brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know them!&rdquo; laughed the professor. &ldquo;I have
them here with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, with you? Well, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered! They
are my very best chums!&rdquo; said Terry. &ldquo;Last summer
I was in Bridgewater, sailing with them, and
we go to Woodcrest together, in fact, we room
together. What are they doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going down to Lower California to visit
my son Ned, on his ranch, and make some scientific
studies, and perhaps look up a treasure that Ned
feels sure that he can find nearby. How did you
come to be out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have a thing to do this summer,&rdquo; explained
Terry. &ldquo;My mother and sister went to visit
friends in New Hampshire, and so I decided to tour
the country in my car. I&rsquo;ve been out here for the
last two days, and I was going to head for Mexico
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;How very strange that we should meet,&rdquo; commented
the professor. &ldquo;You must step up and see
the boys. They will be glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be a bit sorry to see them,&rdquo; returned
Terry, heartily. &ldquo;They certainly will be surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove on until they were almost at the hotel,
and then Terry, who had been thinking deeply, suddenly
began to chuckle. Then, as the professor looked
inquiringly at him, the red-headed boy spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how would you like to
help me in a little joke?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">THE PROWLER IN THE NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>A few minutes later the professor entered the
rooms which he and the two boys had engaged together
alone. He found Don and Jim reading some
magazines which the hotel management furnished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, professor,&rdquo; greeted Don. &ldquo;Safely back,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were beginning to think that you had been
lost,&rdquo; smiled Jim, putting down his magazine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not lost,&rdquo; returned the professor. &ldquo;But
I have had a most extraordinary adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; they asked, in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came across a very distressing thing,&rdquo; the
teacher continued. &ldquo;I wonder if you boys will help
me? Outside, on a lonely street, I met a young man
wandering, and it appears that he has amnesia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amnesia!&rdquo; cried Don. &ldquo;That means loss of
memory, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the professor, seriously. &ldquo;He
could not remember who he was nor where he came
from. I questioned him at length, and while he
answers rationally enough, he simply cannot remember
a thing past a week ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That surely is tough,&rdquo; murmured Don. &ldquo;What
did you want us to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the young man outside here,&rdquo; replied Professor
Scott. &ldquo;I wondered if you two would help
me question him? If we ply him with questions we
may be able to suggest something that will make
him remember who he is and some details of his
past life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to help,&rdquo; said Jim, heartily. &ldquo;Where
is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring him in,&rdquo; replied the teacher, and he
left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mighty hard luck,&rdquo; commented Don. &ldquo;I
hope we can do something to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later the professor returned, gently
leading someone with him. &ldquo;Come right in here,
young man,&rdquo; he said, loudly and gently. &ldquo;There
are only friends in here, so don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you sir,&rdquo; a voice replied. &ldquo;Oh, if you can
only do something for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Scott appeared in the room, leading
with him a dazed-looking young man with red hair
and freckled face, at the sight of whom Don and
Jim sprang to their feet with a cry. The boy looked
at them dully and swallowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terry Mackson!&rdquo; they shouted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the professor, in amazement, as he
pushed the boy down into a large chair. &ldquo;Do you
know this boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly do!&rdquo; Don shot out. &ldquo;This is Terry
Mackson, an old chum of ours. We room with him
at school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor looked down at Terry, who stared
in puzzled wonder at Don. &ldquo;That is very strange.
He doesn&rsquo;t appear to know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he has been hit on the head,&rdquo; suggested
Jim, coming forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is fierce,&rdquo; said Don, worry on his face.
&ldquo;Terry, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shoot if you must this old gray head, but I
don&rsquo;t remember you, she said,&rsquo;&rdquo; was the unexpected
reply, and the corners of his mouth, which had been
quivering, expanded. The professor burst into a
roar of laughter.</p>
<p>The Mercer boys stood for a moment rooted to
the spot, while Terry and the professor laughed in
unrestrained glee. After the first moment of disgust
their eyes narrowed and two determined chins were
thrust forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said Don, quietly. &ldquo;Put out the light. I
don&rsquo;t want the world to witness the awful thing that
is going to happen here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it out yourself!&rdquo; retorted Jim. &ldquo;I am due
for a first class murder, and I&rsquo;m late now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>And with that the two brothers threw themselves
in mock fury onto the body of their laughing friend
and bore him to the floor, where they punched him
soundly, finding their task an easy one, for the red-headed
boy was weak from laughter. When they
had tired themselves they jerked him up and pushed
him into the chair, the professor enjoying it all
hugely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was positively the most low trick I ever
saw,&rdquo; declared Don disgustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have a look at the brain that would
think of such a thing,&rdquo; chimed in Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, boy!&rdquo; laughed Terry. &ldquo;If you could ever
have seen the kindly, anxious looks in your eyes
as you bent over me to help restore my fleeting
memory! My friends, I thank you! If ever I do
lose my identity I shall request that I be taken to
the Mercers, who will surely restore me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up!&rdquo; said Don, beginning to smile. &ldquo;We
admit that we were completely sold that time. Where
in the world did the professor find you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t find him,&rdquo; put in the teacher. &ldquo;Luckily,
he found me.&rdquo; And he related the events of the
evening to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t hurt, I hope, professor?&rdquo; asked Jim,
anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, just bruised a bit. I would have been severely
wet if it had not been for Terry&rsquo;s timely intervention.
It was while on the way over here in
Terry&rsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;remarkable car that he proposed the
trick that was played on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you would go in for such a thing,
professor,&rdquo; said Don. &ldquo;But you can be excused because
you don&rsquo;t know Terry. But in the future never
do anything that he suggests. If you don&rsquo;t get in
trouble you will be sure to lose all respect for yourself,
so I advise against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; smiled the older man. &ldquo;I
enjoyed that little scene in which Terry lost his
mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The part we enjoyed,&rdquo; returned Don, grimly,
&ldquo;was the thumping part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say your letter was taken from you, professor?&rdquo;
asked Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I wanted that more than anything else.
However, it won&rsquo;t do anyone else any good, so I
suppose it is not such a loss, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next hour they talked and Terry related
his experiences during his trip across the country.
He spoke of going on down into Mexico, and the
professor listened, his eyes fixed on the newcomer
thoughtfully. At last he spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come along
with us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Terry grinned. &ldquo;I was hoping you&rsquo;d say just
that,&rdquo; he admitted, frankly. &ldquo;I have no definite plan
in mind, and I would certainly hate to miss any fun
that Don and Jim are in. But on the other hand
I wouldn&rsquo;t want to put you out any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the professor, heartily. &ldquo;Ned
has plenty of room for all of us at his ranch. I&rsquo;m
really taking the boys along so that I won&rsquo;t have
to tramp all over the country looking for Ned&rsquo;s
treasure, and you can come along to help in that
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some talk it was agreed that Terry should
store his car away until such time as they should
want it again. It was late when he left them, agreeing
to meet them on the following day and go to
the steamer with them. The professor and the
Mercers slept soundly that night and the next day
were ready to begin their trip down the coast.</p>
<p>Meeting Terry in the morning they all went down
to the steamer, a small fruit carrier, and the captain
consented to add one to the party. Although the
steamer was not scheduled to start until evening the
friends went aboard early in the afternoon and settled
themselves in their cabin, a good sized room which
was plain but clean. After that they wandered over
the ship, keeping out of the way of the men who
were storing crates, preparatory to their cruise southward
to load fruit. The smell of different grades
of fruit was a permanent part of the black steamer,
and it was by no means unpleasant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>In the evening, just before sailing time, Don and
Jim stood out on the deck, watching the men at
work. The professor and Terry were in the cabin.
Just before the gangplank was hauled in a heavyset
man walked confidently aboard and spoke to the
mate. The captain was nowhere about at the time.
Although not particularly interested the boys noted
that the man had a shifty, watchful look, and that
his eyes were set close together. The mate appeared
to know him and engaged him in conversation,
talking in low tones and looking around sharply
while doing so. At the end of their short conversation,
during which both men looked at the two boys,
the newcomer went forward and they saw no more
of him.</p>
<p>The steamer cast off and headed south, swinging
out in a wide arc, and the voyage was on. Terry
and the professor came on deck at the sound of the
last whistle and together they watched the purple
coast line fade from sight. Supper followed and
they made a hearty meal of it, eating with the
captain at a private table in sight of the main mess
tables.</p>
<p>The evening was spent in talking in the cabin and
in pacing the deck. The night was clear and calm
and the sky dotted with a myriad of stars, and the
steady throbbing of the huge engines made almost
the only sound as they ploughed through the blue
waters of the Pacific. Quite early they turned in and
soon fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>It was Terry who woke up with a sense that
all was not right. He was a lighter sleeper than
the others, and some slight noise had awakened
him. He sat up in his bunk, peering across the
room at a shadow which seemed out of place there.
Thinking it might be one of his chums stirring he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there! Who&rsquo;s prowling around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words, spoken quietly, had an effect that astonished
him. Someone moved out of the shadows
and for a second into the faint light which streamed
in through a port hole. Instantly Terry recognized
one of the men who had attacked the professor on
the previous night.</p>
<p>The man ran to the door, jerked it open and
darted along the narrow hallway that led to the
companionway ladder. Terry swung his feet over
the edge of his bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All hands to repel boarders!&rdquo; he yelled, and
without waiting to put on shoes or clothing, dashed
out of the door after the fleeing man.</p>
<p>The others woke up instantly, to see Terry streaking
down the hall. Terry ran rapidly up the ladder
and saw the intruder slipping over the rail. The
steamer was close into the shore, and without hesitation
the man dropped over into the water and struck
out for the shore, just as Terry gained the rail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>While he watched the man swimming for shore
the others ran up, followed a moment later by the
captain and the mate, a lean-jawed man with a
hooked nose and wide mouth. To their excited inquiries
Terry explained what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use trying to catch him with a boat,&rdquo; decided
the captain, seeing that the man was almost to the
shore. &ldquo;What did he look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry described him, and the professor and the
boys were astonished to find that it was one of the
men who had attacked the professor on the previous
night. The captain broke out in an exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sackett!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know him?&rdquo; asked the professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squint Sackett is one of the worst bay bandits
we have,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;He is a noted river
pirate, and the police would give a whole lot to lay
hands on him. Mr. Abel, how did that man get on
board?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; said the mate, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; asked Jim, in amazement.
&ldquo;Why you let him on board yourself. My brother
and I saw you talking to him this afternoon, just before
we sailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; shouted the mate, darting a bitter
glance at him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Don, coldly. &ldquo;We saw you.
After you and he talked this man Sackett went
forward, and you didn&rsquo;t make any effort to stop
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my suspicious of you for sometime, Mr.
Abel,&rdquo; growled the captain, &ldquo;and now I know you
are crooked. You get off my ship! The first port
we come to you sling your pack and get out. I
can&rsquo;t prove anything on you, but I won&rsquo;t have any
mate of mine having relations with a man like Squint
Sackett. D&rsquo;you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break these kids in two!&rdquo; shouted the mate,
advancing. But the captain, who was bigger than
the mate, quickly barred the way, his heavy fists
raised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You touch these boys and I&rsquo;ll bust you over the
rail!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Get down below and pack up.
Tomorrow you&rsquo;re clearing this ship. Now get!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muttering angrily to himself the mate obeyed,
and when he was gone the captain turned back to the
party. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d advise you to look out for that mate,&rdquo;
he warned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you found out what you
did. Did Sackett steal anything from you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hasty examination of the cabin revealed that
Sackett had been in the act of going through the
professor&rsquo;s inside coat pocket at the time he was
surprised by Terry, but nothing had been taken.
Putting the whole affair down as an attempt at robbery
the captain left them to themselves, assuring
them that no further harm would come to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to keep our eyes open for this
Sackett,&rdquo; said Don, as they went back to their bunks.
&ldquo;For the life of me, I can&rsquo;t see why he should take
the trouble to come aboard and try to rob us. He
must have a mistaken idea that there is a lot of
money in this crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be it,&rdquo; agreed the professor, somewhat
doubtfully. &ldquo;But it does seem strange that he
should take such pains to follow us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder how he knew we were on this particular
boat?&rdquo; mused Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so hard,&rdquo; Terry explained. &ldquo;Perhaps
he hangs around the docks and saw us come aboard
today. But that mate must surely be one of the
gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it,&rdquo; said Don, yawning sleepily.
&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s gone, and we probably won&rsquo;t see anything
of him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if Don and the others could have even guessed
at the plans which were at that moment being
formulated in the evil brain of Squint Sackett they
would have had much food for thought. They were
destined to see him again, and not in the distant
future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">THE SCENE IN THE MOONLIGHT</span></h2>
<p>The sail down the beautiful California coast was
uneventful. The fruit steamer was a staunch old
boat, though somewhat battered, and it kept its
course steadily. After the boys and the professor
had tired of exploring it from end to end and looking
in on the huge engines which drove it with
throbbing energy they spent most of their time on
the deck watching the passing shore line, enjoying
the warmth and brilliant sunshine. The nights,
they found, were cold even in that particular time
of the year, and they were not sorry to use
blankets even in the shelter of their cabins. They
became quite friendly with the captain, who told
them stories of many exciting voyages and some
unusual storms. Nothing further was seen of Sackett
and the mate went sullenly ashore at the first port.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>No storms broke the monotony of fair weather
and quiet sailing, and when at last they entered
Magdalena Bay and approached the settlements they
were almost sorry to leave the fruit steamer. At
ten o&rsquo;clock one bright morning they climbed into the
cutter and were pulled away to the shore, landing at
length on the sandy soil of the small town of Quito.</p>
<p>Ned&rsquo;s ranch lay several miles inland, and the only
means of travel was a lumbering wagon which went
to the mines. Learning that this vehicle was to start
out the following morning they hunted up the driver,
a Mexican, and arranged to drive with him. A small
hotel provided them with a place to put up over
night and after a satisfying supper they wandered
around the town, seeing the sights. The steamer had
gone on its voyage after a brief stop.</p>
<p>The population of the town was very small, and
exceedingly sleepy. Terry remarked that they slept
all day in order to recruit strength enough to play
on guitars at night. The population was composed of
Spaniards, Mexicans, and a few Americans, whose
interest seemed to be chiefly centered in the inland
mines, and a number of halfbreeds. Droves of dogs,
whose seemingly endless variety astonished the boys,
roamed the streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh,&rdquo; exclaimed Jim, as they came around a
pack of them. &ldquo;I used to like pups, but I don&rsquo;t know
as I do after seeing these. Guess I&rsquo;ll look under my
bed when we get back to the hotel and see if there
are any there!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Soft lights gleamed from most of the houses when
evening came on, and the sound of guitars was to be
heard on every street. There were no lights along
the streets, but the night was warm and bright, and
the Americans had no difficulty in walking around
the town. Quite early they returned to their hotel
and after drinking some cold orange drink, went to
bed.</p>
<p>Bright and early in the morning they were up, as
they had been told that the mine wagon was to leave
at six, and after a hearty breakfast went out and
loaded their bags on the vehicle. The driver appeared
shortly afterward, rolling a cigaret with
amazing skill between two fingers. Terry eyed him
in admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By golly!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t smoke and
don&rsquo;t know as I shall, but if I did I&rsquo;d give a lot
to be able to roll &rsquo;em like that! I couldn&rsquo;t roll one
that way with both hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later on, when in the course of their journey the
Spaniard yawned, Terry pretended to be enthusiastic.
Without bothering to take the cigaret out of his
mouth the driver yawned heartily, and the cigaret,
clinging to his upper lip, simply hung suspended
until he closed his lips again. Then he resumed
smoking, the operation being none the worse for the
act, and Terry again shook his head in envy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful people!&rdquo; he whispered to Don. &ldquo;Too
lazy to do anything at all! Wonder what happens
to a cup of coffee when he yawns!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably he keeps right on pouring it down and
doesn&rsquo;t waste any time,&rdquo; chuckled Jim. &ldquo;Great labor
savers, these people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess their hardest work is to keep from doing
any work,&rdquo; smiled Professor Scott.</p>
<p>The wagon was a large open affair, with two long
boards like benches on the side, and the boys and the
teacher sat on the seats with their baggage at their
feet. The driver sat slumped forward on the front
seat, smoking, yawning and dozing by turns, muttering
in broken exclamations sometimes to the horses
and sometimes to himself. Although they tried to
talk to him they received only weary shrugs of his
narrow shoulders, and they soon gave it up and
talked among themselves.</p>
<p>The country through which they were passing led
up in a gradual sweep from Magdalena Bay, and
they soon drew out of sight of that broad sheet of
blue water and plunged on into the more open
country. The soil was somewhat sandy, with an almost
tropical vegetation, and small brooks spread
like silver ribbons toward the sea. As they continued
to work further inland the country became more and
more open, with rolling plains and afar off darker
stretches marked the hills in which the mines were
located.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ned&rsquo;s place is off in that direction,&rdquo; said the
professor, pointing to the southwest. &ldquo;He tells me
that it is in a basin between two small ranges, so
we&rsquo;ll probably come across it all at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At noontime they halted in the shade of a spreading
tree which was more of an overgrown bush, a
species that the professor did not know, and in
which he speedily became interested. The driver
immediately sat in the shade and proceeded to eat
his lunch from a black box which he had, paying not
the slightest attention to them. The boys, wishing
to make some coffee, cut some mesquite bushes which
were nearby and kindled a small fire. Jim set the
coffee to boil and they ate some sandwiches which
they had been wise enough to bring with them.</p>
<p>When the coffee was made Don took some to the
Spaniard, who accepted it with a brief nod of his
head. Terry poked Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Too much
trouble to say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately after the noon meal the driver toppled
over silently and went to sleep, a movement
that afforded Terry much amusement. On this particular
occasion, however, the boys could not blame
him very much. It was hot, so much so that they
were glad to stretch out and nap themselves. At
the end of an hour the driver got up suddenly, resumed
his seat and clicked his tongue at the two
horses. The wagon, with its crew, rumbled on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>It was five o&rsquo;clock when they topped the final rise
and looked down on the Scott ranch. As the wagon
rolled down to the place they had a good opportunity
to study it closely. There was the main ranch building,
a single story affair, constructed of plain boards
that showed up gray and sordid against the declining
sun. Two large barns flanked the house and an
inclosed field with some scattered patches of grass
afforded a ground for a half dozen horses. In back
of the ranch was another frame building, which they
afterward found out was Ned&rsquo;s laboratory, in which
he tested metal from the mines.</p>
<p>Ned Scott was at home when they arrived, in
fact, he had seen the wagon top the rise, and came
riding out to meet them. They saw him swing
carelessly onto the back of a horse and dash up, and
Jim, who was used to riding a cavalry horse at
school, admired the grace and ease with which he
did it. Then, having greeted his father enthusiastically,
Ned Scott was introduced to the boys.</p>
<p>He was a young man in his early thirties, broadly
built, with black hair and eyes and a serious look.
For some years he had lived in practically what was
solitude, seeing a few white men from the mines
and a good many halfbreeds and Mexicans. The
sight of three boys somewhat near his own age was
welcome, and he looked forward to some interesting
days to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>When greetings had been exchanged the young
engineer led the way to the ranch, where the boys
alighted from the mine wagon, and paid the driver.
The man took the money unemotionally and drove
off, having only exchanged a word in Spanish with
Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Terry, as they watched him drive
off. &ldquo;That man is a treat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is so calm,&rdquo; replied Terry, solemnly. &ldquo;And
he is a splendid example. After seeing him I don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;ll ever be fussed or excited over anything
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned Scott led them into the ranch building, a
rough but comfortable place, with a wide, hospitable
living room, a big dining-room, kitchen and a number
of small bedrooms, all on the one floor. There
was a small loft above for storage purposes, but
no real upper floor. After they had stowed their
things away and had made themselves comfortable
Ned took them around the ranch and showed them
the place in detail.</p>
<p>As his chief interest was centered in the mines
he did not raise cattle, but he had one man to take
care of his horses and generally help about the place.
There was also an Indian cook, who was blackened
by the sun and wind until his skin glowed with
a dull color. Ned explained that the man who kept
the horses and the barns was a mestizo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man of mixed Spanish and Indian blood,&rdquo; explained
Ned. &ldquo;Sometimes he is very funny. The
Spanish in him gets very dignified at times and he
is almost stately, and at other times he is just plain
Indian, not much of anything. However, he has
a passion for the horses and he is faithful, and outside
of the fact that I have to drive him to work in
the barns he is all right. I call him Yappi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yappi was seen presently, a tall old man with curiously
mixed white and black hair, a skin that was
a mottled yellow, and dull black eyes. He bowed
to them and passed on, apparently not at all curious.
They inspected the barns and looked with considerable
interest through Ned&rsquo;s laboratory and the
metals from the mines.</p>
<p>Supper was well served by Spanci the cook, and
in the evening they sat on the long low porch talking
until it was time to turn in. After a good sleep they
were up, taking a trip with Ned to the mines. He
led them through the tunnels and explained the complete
workings to them, showing how the silver and
lead was mined. This took up most of the day
and they were thoroughly tired when night came.</p>
<p>Ned was not impressed by the loss of his letter.
&ldquo;Those fellows who attacked you have probably
thrown it away,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write you another
one sometime, dad!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>He asked the boys if they could ride and was delighted
to find that they could. Jim, being a cavalry
lieutenant at Woodcrest, was somewhat better
at it than the others were, but they soon got accustomed
to it. On the third day of their visit Ned
proposed that they take a moonlight ride that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moon, as you noticed last night, is beautiful
just at this time, and there is a lot more fun riding in
the coolness of the night than in the heat of the
day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think you will thoroughly enjoy
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After supper they mounted and rode out of the
ranch grounds, the professor refusing to accompany
them. It was a beautiful night, with a glowing moon
and a sky splashed with stars and they rode for
miles across the open country. The air was clear
and cool, the mountains dark and mysterious near
at hand, and the boys from Maine enjoyed every
minute of it. As they were returning Ned spoke up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we get to the top of the next hill I&rsquo;ll
show you the ranch of my neighbor, Senorita Mercedes,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>His tone was casual, but the boys, remembering
what the professor had said about Ned&rsquo;s interest in
the senorita, felt that he was himself interested in
looking at the place where she lived. He had not
mentioned her name since they had been there, and
Terry did not know anything about her. Nor had
they discussed the treasure as yet, thought the boys,
but that would no doubt come soon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>They topped the rise and paused to rest the graceful,
lively horses while Ned pointed to a small white
ranch which gleamed brightly in the moonlight. The
house itself was small, but the outlying barns were
large, and Ned explained that the senorita was at
present raising cattle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not many of them,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Just enough
to keep her alive and eating regularly. She has
three ranchman and an overseer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near the ranch some trees and mesquite bushes
grew and Don was looking toward this clump
fixedly. He thought that he had detected some movement
there but was not sure. Ned pulled the rein
and turned his horse&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we had better be getting back,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; called Don, in a low voice.
&ldquo;There are two men coming out of that clump of
trees near the ranch and creeping toward the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned spun around in his saddle and looked closely.
Two men were crossing an open space toward the
house, taking care to keep as much as possible in the
shadows. Gaining the side of the house they crept
to a window and one of them reached up and pushed
it. Instantly it swung open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those fellows her ranchmen?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;That is the library
window they just opened. By George, I think they&rsquo;re
going in that window!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s what they are opening it for,&rdquo;
nodded Jim.</p>
<p>Ned dug his heels into the flank of his horse.
&ldquo;Then come on,&rdquo; he shouted, as the first man slipped
through the window. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to see what is
going on in Senorita Mercedes&rsquo; ranch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">SACKETT&rsquo;S RAID</span></h2>
<p>They galloped down the long sloping hill rapidly,
unobserved by the two men who were entering the
Mercedes ranch. The second man had leaped lightly
in the window and disappeared from sight. It was
evident that they feared no interruptions for they
did not even glance out and the party of boys arrived
in the yard without having warned the men
of their coming.</p>
<p>But once in the yard the ring of the horses&rsquo; hoofs
on the hard packed soil reached the ears of the men
inside the house. Two heads appeared swiftly at
the window, at the same time that a candle flickered
upstairs. The men, seeing the party of boys, jumped
from the window with one accord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sackett and Abel!&rdquo; cried Don, as he jumped
from his horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>All the boys had dismounted, which was precisely
the wrong thing to do, for the two men began to run
swiftly for a small patch of trees and bushes which
stood at the edge of the senorita&rsquo;s property. Ned
rushed forward and seized Sackett, who promptly
felled him with a blow on the chin, while Abel kept
on going and entered the grove several yards ahead
of his pursuers. Sackett soon joined him, and before
Terry, who was in the lead, could reach him, he had
joined Abel, who was already on horseback with a
second rein in his hand. Sackett tumbled into the saddle
and the two men thundered away across the
plains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go after them?&rdquo; shouted Jim, as the
senorita appeared on an upper balcony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Ned. &ldquo;They have too big a start,
and I want to find out what they were doing here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat reluctantly the boys turned away, while
the two outlaws put greater distance between themselves
and the ranch party. The senorita, recognizing
Ned in the moonlight, hurried back to her room and
soon appeared at the side door of the ranch house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor Ned, what is it?&rdquo; she called, and the boys
were attracted by her soft and gentle voice.</p>
<p>Ned and the boys walked to the steps, taking
off their hats, and Ned spoke up. &ldquo;We were riding
by at a distance, senorita, and we paused to look
down at your ranch. While we were looking these
two men that just rode away broke in a side window
and entered the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Ned then went on to introduce his friends, to
whom the senorita bowed with a stately grace. They
were quite taken with her beauty and charm, her fine
olive skin and her flashing black eyes. She drew
their admiration, for she was not the least bit
terror stricken by what had happened, but only
thoughtful and puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the library you say, Senor Ned?&rdquo; she puzzled.
&ldquo;But why do you think they should want to go in
my library? What is it that is in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke remarkably good English, with only
a slight accent. Ned shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senorita, I do not know. May we inspect your
library and see if anything is missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Do come right in, and welcome,&rdquo;
she replied, and led the way into the small library
of the Mercedes ranch.</p>
<p>It was a square room filled with books, in cases
reaching to the ceiling. A single table was there,
and two comfortable chairs. Upon examination the
boys found that a few books, in a section which was
filled with ancient, hand-written manuscripts, had
been handled by the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is evident that those fellows were about to
steal some of your valuable manuscripts, senorita,&rdquo;
remarked Ned, after they had made an examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded the girl. &ldquo;But I wonder how those
men knew that I had any books?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much afraid you are wrong in your
ideas,&rdquo; spoke up Don, who had been considering
deeply. And Jim nodded, for his ideas were running
along the same lines of those of his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Don?&rdquo; asked Ned, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that your father was attacked
in San Francisco by this man Sackett, who took
away your letter to him? Well, that letter contained
your ideas about the treasure and that ancient
book which came from this library. Those men
are taking that matter seriously, and they have been
here tonight to try and find the other half of that
Spanish manuscript and learn the exact location of
the wreck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; cried Senorita Mercedes sharply. &ldquo;The
senor is right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly believe that you are!&rdquo; cried Ned.
&ldquo;I had never thought of it all in that light, but
that is surely the answer. Sackett is a freebooter
who will turn his hand to anything that promises
profit, and he has done as you say, taken that letter
seriously. I wish it had never fallen into his hands.
However, with all of his knowledge of the country,
and I suppose he has quite a knowledge of the land,
he doesn&rsquo;t know where the treasure is, so we are
safe on that point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; put in Terry. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll have to be on
our guard from now on. There is no doubt that
that gang will push the search with all vigor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to have faith in the story,&rdquo; said Ned.
&ldquo;I have unlimited faith in it because I have seen
the manuscript, but they are placing their faith in
my letter to my father. There is only one weak
spot in my claim of thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the treasure may have been found and removed
since that book was written. The priest
who wrote the book was going to raise a party to
go back and recover the treasure, but whether he
did or not is not known. He may have done so,
in which case our efforts and plans are absolutely
useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; nodded Don. He turned to the
senorita. &ldquo;Senorita Mercedes, you do not know how
that book ever came to be in your house, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; confessed the girl. &ldquo;As far as I have
knowledge, senor, it has quite always been here.
But I can say this, which will perhaps aid you:
before my family came here to dwell we lived in
Mexico. You see what I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; nodded Ned. &ldquo;You mean that this priest
may at one time have lodged at your house and
have left his book there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have even died there, Senor Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very true. I lean to the belief that the
treasure was never recovered. Well, there are two
parties after it now, so we will have to be on our
guard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Terry, who had walked to the window, spoke
up. He had been examining the double windows,
which opened like doors, with hinges on each side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you keep your windows locked at night,
senorita?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of a certainty, senor,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just wondering,&rdquo; said Terry, slowly. &ldquo;Because
these two fellows just reached up and pushed
the window open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible, Senor Mackson! You may see
that there is a much thick bar across that window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so I notice. But all of the boys will tell
you that they simply reached up and pushed the
window open, and that they didn&rsquo;t have a thing
in their hands when they did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; exclaimed Ned, a sudden light breaking
over him. &ldquo;Senorita, where is Alaroze, your
overseer? How is it that he has not appeared during
all of the excitement? The rest of your men
are outside; I can see them gathered in the courtyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; answered the senorita, &ldquo;I shall
call him at once.&rdquo; She stepped to the door and
clapped her small hands sharply.</p>
<p>There was a slight pause and then a man entered
the room quickly. He was small and chunky, with
a brown face and shifty eyes. He was fully dressed
in the nondescript outfit of a ranch foreman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Senor Alaroze, where have you been?&rdquo; the senorita
asked him in Spanish, which the boys understood
slightly. They had studied the language in
high school, all except Terry, and they could follow
the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand pardons, senorita, but I was
awakened by the noise and hastened to dress,&rdquo; the
Mexican said, softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It took you much time, senor,&rdquo; retorted the
senorita, curtly. &ldquo;Tell me, when you closed up did
you lock this library window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, senorita. I take pains to always carry
out faithfully the tasks intrusted to me,&rdquo; he replied,
his tone becoming haughty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason we ask you, Senor Alaroze,&rdquo; said
Ned, still in Spanish, &ldquo;is because two rascals have
just broken into the house and have searched this
library. But the strange part is that they did not
even have to break in. They simply reached up
and pushed the window and it opened under their
touch. That does not look as though they found the
window barred, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only say that I dropped the bar across the
window before I retired, senor,&rdquo; replied the overseer,
his lips moving uneasily. &ldquo;Perhaps someone
else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Ned, sharply. &ldquo;The senorita
is the only one who sleeps in the house. You and
the ranchmen sleep in the bunkhouse. You do not
think for a minute that Senorita Mercedes came
down and took the bar from the window do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret to say that I do not know what to
think, senor,&rdquo; returned the overseer, quietly enough.
The other boys watched him closely, puzzled at his
calm and speculating as to what thoughts might
be in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is very strange,&rdquo; remarked Ned, closing
the window and dropping the bar in place. When
he spoke there was a trace of gloom in his voice,
especially when he addressed the overseer. &ldquo;Be
more careful in the future, Senor Alaroze. You
alone have the keeping of Senorita Mercedes and
her safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am worthy of the trust, senor,&rdquo; retorted the
overseer, his eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>Ned looked at his watch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be
getting back, or dad will begin to be worried. I
don&rsquo;t think you will have any more trouble, senorita.
If you do, send one of your men to me and I will
come as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The senorita murmured thanks and accompanied
them to the courtyard, where the boys swung onto
their mounts. The three ranchmen, seeing that all
was well, went back to the bunkhouse, while the
overseer, his face hidden in the shadow of the
doorway, stood back of the senorita.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>She bade them goodbye, thanking them once
more. The boys quietly overlooked the fact that
she held onto Ned&rsquo;s hand for a moment longer than
seemed actually necessary. They rode away, looking
back more than once at the gleaming white ranch
in the moonlight, until it was lost to sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much afraid I don&rsquo;t trust that overseer,&rdquo;
said Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;So far he has been very good
in the management of the ranch. I wonder if he
can be in league with that Sackett gang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to tell,&rdquo; said Terry. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the
thought of the senorita living alone with that fellow
around, and not a woman for miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,
either,&rdquo; spoke Ned, frankly. &ldquo;But she claims that
she is not afraid. She goes armed all the time and
is very determined to be a success at raising cattle
and caring for herself. Pride, you know, is something
that the Spanish are great for, and I&rsquo;m afraid
she has more than her share. However, sometime&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish his thought, but the boys
thought that they knew what he had in mind. They
arrived at the ranch in silence and relieved the
professor&rsquo;s anxiety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">THE SEARCH IS BEGUN</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;According to this thing,&rdquo; said Terry, with a
grin, &ldquo;if we find that treasure the dragon will eat
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was on the following day and the entire group
was bent over the manuscript which had been written
by the long dead priest. The book lay spread out
on the library table before them, yellow and fragile,
with corners which threatened to fall away to dust
at their touch. Rotted cord held it together and
had broken in so many places that the ancient book
held together by a miracle.</p>
<p>They had read together the thrilling story of the
flight from the English barks, of the wreck in the
lonely creek, and the description of the treasure up
to the point where the missing pages spoiled the
worthwhileness of the manuscript.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That galleon must have been pretty big,&rdquo; Jim
had said. &ldquo;How big is an English bark?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;A bark is a three-masted, square-rigged vessel.
The mizzenmast is fore-and-aft rigged, if I remember
my history correctly,&rdquo; the professor replied.
&ldquo;There are still barks left in service, and you can
see that they were of a fair size from the fact that
they had three masts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The statement regarding the dragon had drawn
Terry&rsquo;s attention. It was a solemn statement to the
effect that if anyone who was not a subject of His
Sovereign Majesty the King of Spain attempted to
lay hands on the treasure the guardian dragon would
utterly destroy them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t pay much attention to that,&rdquo; smiled
the professor. &ldquo;In the first place, the Spaniards
stole it from the Indians, and it never did belong to
His Sovereign Majesty. We won&rsquo;t worry about the
dragon until we have found the treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had planned to start out on the following
day in an effort to find the river up which the
galleon had sailed. The professor declined to accompany
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys go ahead and do the hunting,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little too old to be riding around the
country looking for gold. But when you find it
I&rsquo;ll help you dig it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we don&rsquo;t find it, we&rsquo;ll have a good camping
trip, anyway,&rdquo; said Ned, who knew that his
father did not place much stock in his ideas regarding
the treasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>It had been agreed that no long trip was to be
arranged just yet. Ned planned to explore the coast
for several miles to the south at present, and if that
failed to show any signs of a river or the wreck to
make preparations for a trip of several days. They
were to be gone overnight this time and that was
all.</p>
<p>So on the following day they were ready to go.
Each boy had a packet of provisions and his blanket
strapped on the back of his saddle and a light automatic
rifle in his hands. The boys had been
taught to shoot with a fair degree of accuracy at
Woodcrest School and so felt no fear of appearing
backward in that respect in Ned Scott&rsquo;s eyes. They
all shook hands with the professor, who wished them
luck, and then they rode away to the southward in
the first step of their hunt for the Spanish treasure.</p>
<p>The day was warm and clear, and before they
had been many hours on the open plain they felt
the heat keenly. The sun beat down directly on the
flat, dry soil, and dancing waves of heat soon showed
above the ground, as far as the eye could see. Ned
would have turned to the distant mountains except
that their search lay along the sea coast and they
would gain nothing by seeking the coolness of the
higher lands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mountains are those?&rdquo; Don asked, pointing
to the sweeping ranges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;That central range which you see is the Sierra
Gigantea,&rdquo; explained Ned. &ldquo;In some places it is
three and four thousand feet above sea level. The
high ranges are north and south, and on this southwestern
side the rocks are granitic. There is plenty
of sandstone on the other slope, and the range is
full of volcanic dykes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks mighty cool up there,&rdquo; said Terry, mopping
his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is. We have all kinds of weather in this
country, from burning tropical heat and its characteristic
vegetation to the icy cold of the peaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the afternoon they halted under a friendly
group of trees and ate a light lunch, stretching out
to talk afterward for a brief time. The afternoon
was even hotter than the morning, and while they
did not feel like sleeping they did enjoy the rest
under the trees. They resumed their journey after
three o&rsquo;clock, keeping the calm blue waters of the
Pacific in sight all the while.</p>
<p>Several creeks were found, but none of them were
wide enough to have ever allowed the passage of
a galleon, although they were forced to bear in
mind the fact that the passage of centuries might
have closed up small rivers or narrowed creeks.
Sandstorms rapidly changed the topography of
countries, they knew. They followed two large
streams for several miles inland and then cut across
country again to the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>When they stopped for their supper Ned said:
&ldquo;The fact is, we may be looking the wrong way.
Perhaps we should have gone north instead of
south. The directions in the manuscript were vague,
much as though the priest himself did not know
just where he was at the time. After all, this
whole hunt is a matter of faith, and if we don&rsquo;t
ever find anything we&rsquo;ll just put it all down as a
good time and a summer vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; rejoined Don, heartily. &ldquo;But I feel
as you do, that the treasure was never found again.
But aren&rsquo;t you neglecting one very good clue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Ned, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You recall that peculiar piece of wreckage that
was picked up by the steam trawler? Well, the
funny thing was that no other piece of the galleon
to which it was a part could be found anywhere
nearby. Don&rsquo;t you feel that it was washed out of
a nearby creek and settled in the mud in the place
where the fishing boat found it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no creek anywhere near it,&rdquo; Ned
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, but it could have come from quite
some distance. Are we near the place where the
piece of wreckage was found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was found about fifty miles further up the
coast,&rdquo; Ned said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is my opinion that somewhere near there the
galleon ran up a river. Can we go there tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ned, slowly. &ldquo;I think if we visit
that spot we had better plan to make a much longer
stay of it. We ought to spend several days in the
vicinity, perhaps a week. Suppose we spend the
night here, go home in the morning and outfit for
an intensive hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a good idea,&rdquo; Jim thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we should,&rdquo; argued Don. &ldquo;You plan to
run over every inch of the coast north and south,
don&rsquo;t you? Then I think we might as well outfit
ourselves for a hard and active campaign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun was now going down, turning the hills and
distant mountains into things of rare beauty as the
multitude of lights danced and gleamed along the
crests of the mighty range. The boys cut enough
wood to last them through the night, and sat around
a glowing little fire, telling Ned of past adventures
until they all were sleepy enough to go to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By golly,&rdquo; said Terry, as he rolled himself up
in his blanket. &ldquo;In the daytime you roast around
here and at night you need a blanket. Very unreliable
climate, I must say. Jim, will you kindly
dust the snow off me when you arise in the morning!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>They were up early in the morning and ate a
hearty breakfast, enjoying the glory of another perfect
day. Ned calculated that they would strike the
ranch again about noontime, and soon they were
in the saddle once more, striking north along the
sea coast. They had gone along the hard sand at
a brisk trot for some ten miles when Jim stopped
and pointed to a group of buildings back against
a sandy cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that place?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a group of tannery buildings,&rdquo; explained
Ned as they jogged on toward it. &ldquo;Years ago, in
the days of the sailing ships, when California and
Lower California were first opened up, hides were
collected inland and dragged to that cliff, where
they were thrown down below, still in a raw state.
Then, while the ships went on up the coast, a picked
crew of sailors remained here, curing the hides and
storing them until the ship returned and picked them
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember reading about it in that fine old
book, &lsquo;Two Years Before the Mast,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Don.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of the chance to see one of the tanneries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they arrived at the mouldering tannery
they dismounted and went inside, examining with
interest this last relic of an ancient business. The
buildings were made of rough logs, hauled for many
miles to the coast, and some scraps of ancient hides
still clung to the storage racks. The vats were still
there, stained with many colors, and a heavy smell
was still noticeable indoors. Outside they found
the framework of the stretching racks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly is interesting,&rdquo; commented Jim.
&ldquo;You must tell your father, Ned. Perhaps he&rsquo;ll
want to come and look at the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell him,&rdquo; the young engineer nodded, as
they resumed their journey.</p>
<p>Ned&rsquo;s calculations were correct, for it was just
noontime when they arrived at his ranch. They
rode down the incline toward the house, which
looked deserted. Ned whistled but there was no
response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe dad is still in bed,&rdquo; he laughed, as he
swung from his horse.</p>
<p>But when they went into the house the professor
was not to be found. Nor was the cook around.
Ned hurried to the barns and looked for Yappi,
but in vain. As he hurried back to the house Don
called to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Ned,&rdquo; Don said. &ldquo;There is a
note from him on the table. He has gone out looking
for plant specimens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned hastened into the room, relief on his brown
face, and took up the note. It was a simple message,
worded as Don had explained, but as Ned
read it his brow darkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, crisply. &ldquo;Do you know
what dad&rsquo;s first name is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Don, and Jim shook his head.
Don pointed to the note. &ldquo;I see he signed it &lsquo;Duress
Scott.&rsquo; I never heard of that name before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a name,&rdquo; was the startling answer. &ldquo;Dad
signed it that way to let us know that he signed it
under duress, under compulsion! The cook and the
overseer are both gone, evidently carried off by the
same gang who captured dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet everything I&rsquo;ve got that it is Sackett
again!&rdquo; groaned Jim. &ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as soon as we can tie up a little grub and
fill up with plenty of ammunition we&rsquo;ll start to run
those fellows down,&rdquo; said Ned, grimly. &ldquo;I think
it is high time that somebody put an end to Mr.
Sackett and Company, and we&rsquo;re going to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; cried Terry. &ldquo;War to the
knife! Where is my gun?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">THE RUINED CASTLE</span></h2>
<p>The professor enjoyed his day of solitude. Long
years of serious study and instructive reading had
made him one of the men who prefer being alone
to mixing with a noisy crowd. Not that the professor
was the least bit snobbish or unsociable, but
he loved the quietness of inner thought and the companionship
of a book.</p>
<p>After the boys had disappeared over the hill he
returned to the living room and sat in a sunny
window looking out over the rolling country which
extended for miles back of Ned&rsquo;s ranch, away to
the purple mountains in the distance. A feeling of
warm contentment came over the elderly man, for
an hour or more he simply dreamed there, enjoying
the comfort of Ned&rsquo;s best armchair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>After that he read for a long time, until the cook
announced that dinner was ready. He ate alone,
well served by the silent Indian and then went back
to smoke his pipe and dream in the window once
more. When afternoon came on he imitated the actions
of the cook and Yappi, who both went to
sleep, the cook in a bunk off the kitchen and Yappi
beside the barn, his battered hat over his eyes.
The professor sought the dull colored sofa in the
living room and slept until the sun began to go
down.</p>
<p>He awoke much refreshed and drank copiously,
realizing for the first time in his long life just how
good water could be. Another lone meal followed
and he spent the evening with another book, sitting
under the oil lamp until it was nearly time to
go to bed. Then, enchanted with the fine moonlight,
the professor went out on the front porch to
smoke a final pipe before retiring.</p>
<p>The whole landscape was flooded by the brilliant
slice of moon which hung far over in the sky, and
the professor drank in its beauty. The cook had
finally cleared up everything in the kitchen and gone
out to the small bunkhouse, to listen for a time to
the guitar which Yappi was playing and then finally
to coax the old mestizo into playing a game of cards
with him, over which they droned half asleep, seriously
intent. When Professor Scott had finished
his pipe he knocked out the ashes, yawned and with
a final look around, went to his room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>This was in the back of the long, low building,
facing the plains and mountains. He opened the
window and finding that there was enough light
from the moon, extinguished the lamp which he
had lighted and took off his necktie. His eyes
wandered dreamily over the landscape. Then he
suddenly stopped unbuttoning his collar, his eyes
narrowed, and he became all attention.</p>
<p>On the top of a sand dune a man was standing
and looking toward the ranch. It was only for an
instant and then the man disappeared, slipping down
the other side noiselessly. He had on a cape and
a sombrero, and the professor was puzzled. He
wondered if Yappi or the cook had left the place,
and after a moment of thought he went back to the
front porch and looked around. There was no light
in the bunkhouse now. But when he started to go
out there he saw the cook walking toward the
kitchen door and the ranchman coming out of the
barn.</p>
<p>His first impulse was to speak to Yappi, but thinking
it useless to alarm the man he returned to the
house and to his room. It was not either of the
men whom he had seen, but some stranger who was
carefully looking down on the ranch. It was possible
that it was only some chance wayfarer who had
topped the rise and was examining the ranch, but
the professor knew that Sackett was in the neighborhood
and that it would be well to keep his eyes
open. For an hour he looked steadily out of the
window, but he saw nothing more to alarm him,
and at last, after making a tour through the house
and locking every door and window, including the
window in his bedroom, he went to bed and soon
fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>When morning came he was awakened by the
sound of the cook trying the back door, and he
hastily opened it for the Indian. The cook answered
his cheery morning greeting unemotionally. The
Indian had never known Ned to lock the doors, and
he wondered why the older man did it, but no sign
of his thoughts appeared on his shiny dark face and
he set about getting breakfast ready. The professor
dressed and then sat down to his morning meal,
after a hasty look around to see that all was well.</p>
<p>Yappi had already attended to the horses when
the professor went out to take a walk around the
ranch, and the mestizo was busy in the barn. After
enjoying the clear morning outside the professor
went back to the house and once more resumed his
reading, sitting in the window through which the
sun came brightly. From where he was sitting he
could see Yappi at work on a saddle, mending a
flap on it, sitting on the low doorstep of the bunkhouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The professor had read for perhaps a half hour
and was in the act of turning a page when he
happened to look up and out at the old mestizo. The
man had ceased his stitching and was looking back
of the house, the saddle hanging loosely in his hand.
And to the professor&rsquo;s vast astonishment, he suddenly
tossed the saddle over his shoulder and with
the agility of a cat rolled himself without rising
into the doorway of the bunkhouse.</p>
<p>Struck with amazement at the man&rsquo;s actions the
teacher put down his book and got up, striding for
the front door. But even before he reached it he
heard the back door pushed open and he turned.
His worst fears were realized when he found
Sackett standing on the threshold, a rifle in his
hand, and Abel just back of him. Both men were
smiling in triumph, but keeping a wary eye on the
house just the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Sackett, grinning broadly. &ldquo;We
didn&rsquo;t know you was going out the front door,
governor! Or maybe you was goin&rsquo; to let us in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo; asked the professor,
stiffly.</p>
<p>Sackett looked all around. &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t sure, yet.
We want you, for one thing. Keep your gun on
him, Abel. Where&rsquo;s Manuel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watching the front door,&rdquo; growled the former
mate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>The two men stepped into the house and the
professor saw that he was trapped. He had no
idea what the men wanted with him, although his
heart sank a little he resolved to face them unflinchingly.
Out of the corner of his eye he saw the cook
glide out of the back door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two men get out of this house!&rdquo; the professor
snapped.</p>
<p>Sackett laughed and walked boldly through the
rooms, while Abel kept his rifle pointed in the professor&rsquo;s
direction. After he had looked through every
room the leader came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody else in the place, just like Manuel said,&rdquo;
he reported. He faced the old savant. &ldquo;Where did
those boys go to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off on a camping trip,&rdquo; answered the professor,
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they didn&rsquo;t go looking for that treasure?&rdquo;
inquired the outlaw, thrusting his face close to Mr.
Scott&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that you believe that story?&rdquo;
sniffed the professor, scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it, and so do you,&rdquo; replied the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fairy story,&rdquo; said the professor, contemptuously.
&ldquo;My boy has long since found out that there
isn&rsquo;t anything to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your boy know more about that treasure
than you feel like telling,&rdquo; retorted Sackett.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming with us and stay with us until you
tell us what you do know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll stay with you a long time,&rdquo; said the
professor, humorously. &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t know anything
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stow the talk and come on,&rdquo; growled the mate.
&ldquo;Want them boys to come back again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we had better get moving,&rdquo; agreed the
leader of the gang. He walked to the desk and took
out a piece of paper and a pen, which he dipped in
the ink. &ldquo;You write a note saying you have gone
for a little exploring trip,&rdquo; he directed the professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t write a line!&rdquo; said the professor, stubbornly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You write quickly or I&rsquo;ll punch your head!&rdquo;
growled the outlaw, raising his heavy fist.</p>
<p>Convinced that he would gain nothing by arguing
with these men the professor took the pen and
wrote a short note. He hesitated a moment and
then signed it &ldquo;Duress Scott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; cried Sackett, suspiciously. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that
you&rsquo;re putting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to sign my name, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
asked the teacher, blandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t your name,&rdquo; argued the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t, eh?&rdquo; said the professor. &ldquo;Very well,
I&rsquo;ll sign it just plain Dad, and then Ned will know
that something is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>The leader thought a moment. &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he
growled. &ldquo;That will do as it is. Now come along,
and mind, no funny business, or it will be the worse
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor accompanied them out of the house,
jealously guarded by the two men, and in the back
yard Manuel, a short and stolid Mexican, was
waiting for them with a horse from Ned&rsquo;s own
stock. In silence the professor mounted and the
cavalcade moved out of the ranch grounds, the professor
looking around for the cook and Yappi.
Neither of them were in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miserable cowards!&rdquo; muttered the professor, between
his set teeth.</p>
<p>They headed for the mountains, the Mexican in
front and the professor riding just ahead of Sackett
and Abel, who kept watchful eyes on him. They
travelled in silence during the morning and stopped
at noon to eat and rest, after which they pushed
on, in a direction southwest of the mines. Manuel,
it seemed, was the lookout and rode ahead to see
to it that they did not unexpectedly run across some
party from the mines or from other scattered
ranches. They had passed to the north of the Senorita
Mercedes ranch and there was no help from that
quarter. And when at last they entered the trees
at the foot of the central range they had not been
seen by anyone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>There Manuel waited for the party and they rode
on in a compact body, ascending the long slopes,
skirting abrupt cliffs and rising high above sea level.
The woods were of a semi-tropical nature, with
thick trees and bright green leaves, surrounded by
dense bushes of undergrowth. It was cool above
the level of the plain and they made good time,
coming out onto a flat plateau late in the afternoon.
Before them was a wall of vegetation, and to the
professor&rsquo;s astonishment they rode straight to it,
pushed their way through and came unexpectedly
upon the ruins of a small castle.</p>
<p>The building was small and now nothing more
than a tumbled heap of ruins. Looking at it closely
the professor was inclined to think that it had
never been completed at all, but had been abandoned
before the roof had been put on. Creepers grew
in reckless profusion all over the stones and a bright
green snake glided across a door sill with a slight
hiss. The men sprang from their horses and the
professor got down slowly, waiting the next move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Guided by his captors he was led across the first
floor of the place, evidently the effort of some
Spanish nobleman to plant a small empire of his own
in a new country, and ushered into a single room
toward the back of the castle. This room had a
ceiling to it and he could see at once that it was
the headquarters of the gang. A stove, made out of
bricks held together by clay, stood in one corner and
several strings of red peppers, dried with heat and
age, hung from strings over the stove. A rough
table, two chairs and a bench, and a long box
made up the furniture of the place. Besides the
door, which was constructed of heavy wood, there
was a single window in the place, which was barred,
though it had no glass in it. The forest grew close
to the back of the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here,&rdquo; commanded the leader, as soon
as they were all in the room. &ldquo;Are you going to
talk, or do we have to starve it out of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean I am to tell you anything about that
treasure, I guess you&rsquo;ll have to starve me,&rdquo; returned
the professor, with spirit. &ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t
know a thing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sackett turned to Abel. &ldquo;No use arguing with
this man now, I can see that. Maybe when he gets
hungry he&rsquo;ll sing another tune. Put him in the
dungeon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without wasting a word on the matter Abel
drove the professor before him to a small door which
opened in one side of the room. This door, when
opened, disclosed a turning flight of narrow stairs,
and down this the professor went, guided by the
light from a lantern which Manuel had lighted and
handed to the mate. After turning around and
around they came suddenly to a narrow cell, in
front of which swung a heavy wooden half door,
the upper part of which was composed of iron bars.
Abel opened the door by pulling it toward him and
then pushed the professor inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stay there until you get hungry,&rdquo; he said, grimly.
&ldquo;When you feel like talking just yell for the captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He closed the door with a sharp slam, snapped
a padlock in place, and taking the light with him,
remounted the stairs. The professor stood still,
watching the light flash and twinkle on the white
stone steps until it was gone and he was in the darkness
alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">THE ROPE IN THE DUNGEON</span></h2>
<p>The light was gone at last and with it the professor&rsquo;s
hope. He was totally alone in the inky
darkness, a prisoner in a cell whose size he was not
certain of, down under the ruins of a castle in the
woods. Far above him he could hear the slam of
another door and the faint footsteps of the two
men. Then there was complete silence and the teacher
turned away from the barred door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A truly ancient castle,&rdquo; grumbled the professor.
&ldquo;The dungeon completed before the rest of the
house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wondered, as he moved cautiously around if
anyone had ever been a prisoner in this cold and
wet-smelling cell. He found his way around without
difficulty, running his hands along the wall and
extending his feet carefully. There was not a single
object in the place, and he felt that they had not
expected to have him there, for there was no bed
or chair in the place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; thought the savant, as he continued to
feel his way around. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t be decent
enough to give me a chair or bed, anyway. No use
in expecting mercy from villains like these, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The walls were perfectly smooth, composed of
sandstone, as was the entire castle. Ned had told
his father that the opposite slope of the mountain
was almost wholly composed of this particular type
of stone, and the original owner and builder had
no doubt had it quarried and dragged to the spot,
using Indians who had been taken captive by the
Spaniards. Such was the professor&rsquo;s belief and it
was reasonable. Even in his anxiety to escape from
these men he found himself taking an interest in
the place and resolved that if these men were ever
cleaned out of it he would explore it thoroughly.</p>
<p>The floor was also of stone, wet and slippery,
and for all the professor knew, the dwelling place
of spiders and other crawling things. He hated to
sit down on it, but there was no other place and
he was very tired from his long ride and the excitement
of it all, so he felt around the floor with
shrinking hand and finally found a spot near the
door which seemed to be drier than the rest of the
floor. Pretty much exhausted the history professor
sank to the floor and rested his back against the
cold wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>He was in some doubt as to what to do. He felt
that Ned would catch on to his meaning when he read
the word &ldquo;duress&rdquo; and the boys would surely make
a vigorous effort to find him, but how long that
would be or what would happen in the meantime he
had no idea. The men upstairs were convinced that
he knew something about the treasure, that he possessed
some information which he was withholding,
and they would do their best to get it out of
him. They would try to starve him first, and in
that fact he found a ray of hope, for it would take
them several days to find out that he did not intend
to say anything, and then they would adopt a more
severe program. In that time Ned and the boys
from Maine would have time to find him, and they
would naturally look near the mountains. It was
possible that they might think he had been carried
off to sea, but surely the cook or Yappi would tell
them the true facts of the case, provided they hadn&rsquo;t
been so frightened that they hadn&rsquo;t even seen in
which direction the cavalcade had gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>But if the men decided to change their plans and
try to pump information from him he would have
a bigger problem on his hands. These men were
by no means gentle, they were men who were willing
and able to sweat hard to earn money and especially
dishonest money, and they would not be
likely to stop at anything cruel or inhuman. They
were miles away from any source of help and the
woods would effectually hide any story which might
shock the outside world if it were known. Sackett
and the mate must know that the boys would soon
be on the trail, and he was inclined to think that
they would resort before very long to methods other
than peaceful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is the case,&rdquo; thought Professor Scott,
jumping to his feet, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just wasting time by sitting
here. There seems to be no way of getting out
of the place, but it may be that there is some flaw
that will ultimately prove my biggest help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So once more he began to feel his way along the
wall and then stopped as a new thought came to
him. A few days before Ned had given him a cigar
lighter, a somewhat unreliable engine that lighted
once in a great while, but which always gave off
a bright flash when the little wheel was turned by
the thumb. It was in his vest pocket and he reached
for it. He had not had any matches with him and
had secretly lamented the fact, but now his main
difficulty was in a fair way to be overcome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>He took the little case from his pocket and spun
the wheel. A sputtering little flash was the answer,
which lighted up the cell for a split second and gave
him his bearings. It was evident that the cigar
lighter had no intentions whatsoever of lighting for
any length of time, but it at least gave forth a flash
that threw the heavy stones into a sort of bluish
picture for an instant. Working it constantly the
old gentleman moved around the dungeon, exploring
the walls and floor, until something in one corner
arrested his attention.</p>
<p>There was a crevice there, running from the floor
to the ceiling and in that crack was a moulded rope.
The rope ended near the floor, and hung straight
down from a round hole in the ceiling above him.
He took hold of the rope, to find it wet and slippery
but fairly strong. The men had evidently not seen
it and he knew why. Anyone who stood in the
room and threw the beams of a lantern around
would cast the light in a confused way into the
corners and so miss seeing the rope, which was deep
in the cranny, and indeed the professor would not
have seen it himself if he had not been standing
right at the crevice. Probably the men had never
gone over the walls inch by inch, and unless one
did that the hidden rope would surely escape their
eye. But now that he had the rope, what was he to
do with it?</p>
<p>He pulled on the rope and his answering came
with a suddenness that startled him into stepping
back hastily. Far above his head a bell pealed out
sharply, shattering the silence of the mountain fastness
with disconcerting vigor. Nervously he dropped
the lighter and then picked it up, his brow wet with
a nervous perspiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; murmured the professor. &ldquo;I
must stop that, or I&rsquo;ll have them down on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upstairs there was a moment of silence and then
a sudden commotion. A chair fell over and he heard
running footsteps. Apparently the upper door was
opened, for he could hear the words of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is ringing that bell?&rdquo; he heard Sackett
roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got me, captain,&rdquo; replied Abel, while rapid
chattering in Mexican reached the ears of the professor.
&ldquo;That bell is just up there in the tower
and nobody can ring it. There must be ghosts in
this place, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep shut about your ghosts!&rdquo; snarled the
leader. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that Mexican saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s howling prayers because he&rsquo;s scared,&rdquo; the
mate said.</p>
<p>Understanding came over the professor all at
once. One tall tower had struck his attention as
they had approached the ruined castle and it was
evident that this tower had in it a large bell, placed
there when the castle was first built. The rope which
the professor had pulled led directly to this bell, a
circumstance of which the men upstairs knew
nothing, and he found that fate had provided him
with a weapon to work against them with telling
force. Realizing in the long run what this would
mean the teacher once more took hold of the rope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody is ringing that bell,&rdquo; said Sackett, his
tone ugly and uncertain. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t there no way to get
up in that tower and stop it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Abel. &ldquo;The tower has no steps
and it&rsquo;s no use anyway. I tell you a spirit is ringing
that bell! I knew I hadn&rsquo;t ought to have come
in on a game like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up,&rdquo; growled Sackett. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t ringing
anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at that moment the bell rang out, and this
time the professor used it effectively. With long
sweeping strokes he tolled it, so that the melancholy
sounds sounded out and over the country for miles.
It was a solemn and fearful sound, and the men
above were thoroughly awed and frightened by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go see if that professor has escaped from his
cell,&rdquo; ordered Sackett, as the professor paused in his
labors. &ldquo;He may be out and doing this somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor thanked his lucky stars that he had
overheard this bit of conversation and gave the bell
a final toll. Then he quickly resumed his place near
the door, holding onto the bars and peering anxiously
out as the mate came down the stairs with the
lantern.</p>
<p>The man flashed the light full in the face of the
professor, who blinked and threw up his hand to
cover his eyes. At the same time he eagerly questioned
the mate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why is that bell ringing? What does it mean?
Why is there a bell here?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>The mate looked troubled but attempted to pass
it off. &ldquo;You mind your own business,&rdquo; he said,
in a surly tone. At the same time he pressed close
to the door and flashed the light into the dungeon,
looking intently at the corners. Without another
word he went back up the winding stairs, and before
he closed the door the professor heard him say:
&ldquo;The old man is all right. He hasn&rsquo;t been out of
the cell and he couldn&rsquo;t ring the bell. I tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was as much as Professor Scott heard but
it was enough to satisfy him. His best plan was
now to mystify the men in the hope of terrifying
them so that they would leave the place and take
him somewhere else. Whether that would in the
end be a better move or not he did not know, but
it was at least better than waiting and wasting
time, and it would serve to bring Ned and the boys
to the spot. There was no doubt that the sound
could be heard far from the mountain, and he had
no doubt that it would be of great value to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Feeling that it would do him no good to keep on
tolling the bell he gave up the task for the time
being, planning to ring it wildly in the very middle
of the night. The men would no doubt be asleep
and he could ring it out in such a way as to bring
them to their feet with fast beating hearts, convinced
that the place was haunted by a spirit that
rang the bell. If they persisted in staying even after
that he would keep ringing the bell at intervals,
taking care not to break the rope, which, fortunately
for him had originally been tarred and so was preserved.</p>
<p>With that thought in mind the professor pulled
his coat more closely around him, curled himself
up on the hard floor and went to sleep. His sleep
was fitful and restless, and after two hours of it
he had the impression that something nearby was
scratching. Awakening at last he sat up, wide
awake in an instant, to find that the steady scratching
sound was no dream, but an actual fact, and
seemed to come from the wall beside him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE</span></h2>
<p>The scratching sound continued to come as the
professor listened, and he got up and bent his head
close to the wall. It sounded to him as though
someone was scraping the rock wall on the other
side of his cell, and he was puzzled over the circumstance.
There was a measure of hope in the
sound, perhaps the boys had arrived and were trying
to break through to him. But as he continued
to think it over he realized that it could not be so.
The dungeon was deep in the earth and it would
be impossible for them to get down on a level with
his cell. The only other thing he could think of
was that there was a prisoner in a cell next to his.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>It might easily be possible that Sackett, in some
of his other dishonest games, had taken someone
else prisoner and the man was trying to break
through to him. In that case it behooved the professor
to try and help whoever was coming through
the wall of his dungeon. He took the cigar lighter
from his pocket, made it flash and then looked at
his watch by its brief blue flame. It was now one
o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Continuing to make flashes the teacher watched
the wall and after a time found the rock upon which
the unknown man was working. It was a large
block in the very center of the south wall, and under
the soft blows of the man on the other side it was
already slightly loose. The professor could see it
move. He took out a knife which he had and began
to pick at the edges on his side, chipping carefully
and as noiselessly as possible. It was evident
that the person on the other side knew that he was
helping for the scraping stopped abruptly but after
a moment it was resumed.</p>
<p>They worked on in silence, the professor listening
for sounds from upstairs, but none came. The men
were evidently asleep or they had left the place altogether,
for he heard no movement and he was
not interrupted in his labors. He found that the
soft and rotted material between the stones was easy
to dislodge, and his mysterious helper was pushing
as he worked, so that the huge stone was beginning
to move toward the cell of the professor. Only a
fraction of an inch at a time, but it was enough to
give the teacher hope, and finally it was far enough
out to allow him to get the tips of his fingers under
the rough edge of the stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>By working it back and forth the professor at
length got it loose. It came out with a rush, nearly
bending him double with the unexpected weight. At
the same time a light flared in his eyes and he
hastily deposited the stone on the floor of his dungeon.
When this was completed he straightened up
and confronted his companion.</p>
<p>It was Yappi, the mestizo. He held a torch of
pitch wood in his one hand and a keen knife in
the other. He had evidently worked hard at the
stone, for his hands were dirty and so was his
mouth and forehead, showing that he had stopped
more than once to wipe them with his dirty hands.
The professor was glad to see the man but more
than astonished at what he saw back of him. The
ranchman was standing in a vaulted underground
passage, which ran back a distance that the professor
could not make out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yappi!&rdquo; cried the professor, in a low voice.
&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I followed you, senor,&rdquo; said the old man, simply.
&ldquo;It was somewhat hard work, for my feet are not
so swift to run as they once were. But when I
knew that they had carried you off to this castle I
laughed inside, for I knew this castle very well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>In one sense Yappi was a mystery. He was an
ordinary mixture of Spanish and Indian, and yet
not ordinary in other ways. He possessed a dignity
and his English was perfect. Ned Scott could never
learn where he got it. Except for rare periods when
he became sulky or falsely sensitive he was always
steady and reliable. The professor had greatly misjudged
him when he had thought him a coward,
and later on apologized, an apology which was very
graciously accepted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this underground passage?&rdquo; whispered
the professor eagerly, forgetting his situation in his
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as old as the castle, senor, and I have known
of it since I was a child. Many times I have played
around these ruins. But come, we waste time and
must be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opening that the removal of the stone had
made was not a big one and the professor had a hard
struggle to get out, in fact Yappi was compelled to
haul him through bodily. Of a necessity the professor
squirmed out and landed on his face, grumbling
at the man who had made him resort to so
clumsy a method of action. Once in the passage he
looked around, finding that it was made of stone and
arched overhead, the entire height being about seven
feet. Consequently they were not compelled to bend
over, and they hurried through the passage in comfort,
the ranchman in the lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was this passage ever made for?&rdquo; the
professor asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, senor. It may be that once that
room was not a dungeon, or it may be&mdash;but who
knows? Only I happened to know of the passage
and knew that they would put you in that cell, so
I have been at work for some hours on the stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly appreciate your hard work, Yappi,&rdquo;
said the professor.</p>
<p>The mestizo made no reply. The professor noted
that the passage was sloping upward somewhat, and
before long he felt cool fresh air on his cheek. Near
the entrance Yappi extinguished the torch by grinding
it under his heel and they proceeded in the darkness,
until the mestizo stopped and grasped his arm,
pointing silently ahead.</p>
<p>The end of the passage was before them, and
lounging there, a rifle in his hands, was the mate
Abel. They could make out the lines of his body
plainly as he stood near a mound, totally unconscious
that he was within five feet of a secret tunnel. The
professor could see that the mouth of the secret
passage was screened in some dense bushes and that
it curved right up from the ground. But in spite of
all their brilliant work Abel suspected something,
and for the time being at least they were halted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>They held a council of war right there, speaking
in whispers. It was evident that the mate had heard
something or had the feeling that all was not well,
for he stood on his guard, the rifle held slightly
forward. Yappi was for rushing him and fighting
it out, but the professor opposed it firmly. The
man was armed and Yappi was not, and the ranchman
was old and none too strong. Beside all that,
the professor had another thought.</p>
<p>He asked the old man if he had heard the bell
tolling and the mestizo replied that he had. Professor
Scott then went on to tell him how it was
done, and to propose that he steal back and ring the
bell, thus puzzling the men and taking Abel away
from his most inconvenient post. The mestizo gravely
approved of his plan and together they retraced their
steps until they came to the hole in the wall.</p>
<p>Knowing where the bell rope was even in the
darkness the professor insisted upon being the one
to go back into the dungeon, so with Yappi&rsquo;s help
he once more pushed and puffed his way through
the hole. He landed on the other side pretty well
mussed up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound these fellows,&rdquo; he growled inwardly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost several pounds squirming in and out of
these holes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had regained his feet and was tiptoeing toward
the bell rope when a warning hiss from Yappi
reached him. He turned toward the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Yappi?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back! Light coming!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Surely enough, at that moment a light flashed on
the winding steps and began to descend. The professor
made a wild dive for the hole and then stopped
with a groan. It would take him several moments
to worm his way back into the passage, and already
it was too late for that. Sackett was coming down
the stairs with the lantern, and he was now in plain
sight around the last turn.</p>
<p>For an instant the professor remained rooted to
the spot as though paralyzed. The leader of the
gang was approaching the door, holding the lantern
before him, his eyes squinted more than usual as
he tried to see into the cell. Yappi had disappeared
somewhere, and the professor felt suddenly alone
and miserable.</p>
<p>Sackett looked in the dungeon and his eyes fell
on the block which had been removed. With a
snarling oath he saw the hole in the wall and turned
red and angry eyes on the professor. But the old
teacher had decided on his course of action.</p>
<p>Without fully realizing why he did it the professor
stepped to the bell rope and pulled it with all
his strength. The bell in the tower pealed out with
a terrific clash, sending the tocsin booming out over
the mountain side. Sackett saw the move and a
great light swept over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he shouted, above the clanging of the bell.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who is ringing that bell!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Swinging the handle of the lantern over his arm
he dived viciously into his pocket for the key to
the padlock. As he did so there was the sound of
running footsteps over his head and Abel&rsquo;s voice
reached them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bell is ringing again, Sackett!&rdquo; the mate
cried, his voice showing his alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and here is the bird that is ringing it!&rdquo;
roared the leader. &ldquo;Get down here right away,
Abel! Where is Manuel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ran away, scared to death,&rdquo; replied the mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get down here and help me choke this old one,&rdquo;
commanded Sackett, thrusting the key into the padlock.</p>
<p>But Abel called down once more, and there was a
new note in his voice. &ldquo;Never mind him, Squint!
Get up here as fast as you can! Here come a whole
rescue party, with all them blasted kids in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor gave the bell one last pull of
triumph and then let the rope go. Sackett hesitated
for a moment, muttering savagely to himself and
holding onto the padlock and key. Then he turned
and ran up the steps, dashing the lantern against
the wall in his hurry, causing the glass to break
and go tinkling down the stone steps.</p>

<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE TOLLING OF THE BELL</span></h2>
<p>The four boys hastily armed themselves to go
and find the professor. Ned packed some provisions
in a knapsack and slung it behind his saddle, not
knowing just how long they might be on their hunt.
The other boys watered their horses and Ned&rsquo;s and
waited around for him to get ready.</p>
<p>Just before leaving Ned made a final look around,
greatly puzzled at the absence of Yappi and the
cook. &ldquo;Must have taken them prisoner, too,&rdquo; was
his conclusion, as he joined the others. It was a
somewhat grim cavalcade that swung out of the
ranch yard.</p>
<p>There were two possibilities, the sea and the
mountains. One guess was as good as the other,
but Ned chose the mountains and they headed that
way. They had gone but a scant mile when Don
pulled up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this coming?&rdquo; he asked, pointing to a
lone figure which was running over a nearby hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like the cook,&rdquo; said Ned. It was Spanci
and he drew nearer, evidently recognizing them.
When he came up he was slightly out of breath but
able to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spanci, where have they taken my father?&rdquo; asked
Ned, in Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have taken him to the mountains, senor,
but do not fear, Yappi is with him, trailing them.&rdquo;
The cook then went on to tell of the raid and of
Yappi&rsquo;s stealthy trailing and his own effort. &ldquo;I
ran to the ranch of the Senorita Mercedes, senor,
and she has sent her overseer and two men out to
the mountain to aid your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned thanked the old Indian for his devotion and
the cook went on back to the ranch, to await the
turn of events. Ned was greatly relieved to hear
that Yappi was on the trail, and he knew that the
old mestizo would stick to it and help his father no
matter what turned up. It was with a much more
cheerful heart that the party rode on toward the
mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt they will stop and hold dad somewhere
for a day or two,&rdquo; argued Ned. &ldquo;We should
run across them shortly, and if it is possible Yappi
will leave some kind of a guiding sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best part of it is that we know now that
they didn&rsquo;t go toward the sea,&rdquo; put in Terry and
Ned nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>They stopped briefly late in the afternoon to eat
and rest the horses and in the early evening reached
the edge of the mountain range. Once within the
shadows of the mighty trees they were at a loss as
to how to go. Had the party gone north or south?
It was a big decision to make, for if they proceeded
far in one direction and found that they were wrong
they would have to retrace and lose valuable time.
Just as the last shadows of the day were stealing
across the sky they stopped for a council of
war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to indicate which way they
would be likely to go,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t they be most likely to go south, to
get away into a wilder country?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;But the northern part of the
range is the wildest. So we can&rsquo;t tell. They may
have even gone right on over, to the waste of wilderness
on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whichever way we guess we may be dead
wrong,&rdquo; murmured Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we can&rsquo;t afford to be wrong,&rdquo; Ned
answered. &ldquo;Look here, we&rsquo;ll have to split the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Split the party?&rdquo; echoed the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Don and I will go south, and Jim and
Terry north and over the top. In that way we
should be able to cover a lot of territory. I propose
that we make this spot our meeting place, and that
we all assemble here at seven o&rsquo;clock tomorrow
morning to compare notes. Let&rsquo;s have a signal of
three shots. That will mean to either come back to
the meeting place, or ride toward the shots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better make it the signal to ride toward the
shots,&rdquo; advised Don. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll repeat the shooting
and keep it up until the other party joins us. But
if one party picks up Professor Scott it had better
ride back here with him and fire the shots from here,
because we all know just where this place is and
can find it easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Ned. &ldquo;Of course, we are
splitting our party and lessening our strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that we can help that,&rdquo; Jim argued.
&ldquo;If we were looking for something that didn&rsquo;t require
every minute we could keep together and take
our time. But there is no knowing what the outfit
will do to the professor. Besides, two of us should
be able to handle those fellows, even if there are
three of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be able to depend on a surprise attack,&rdquo;
said Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Ned. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others looked at him questioningly. Ned
listened intently. &ldquo;I thought I heard the sound of
a bell tolling,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where would there be a bell around here?&rdquo; asked
Don.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that there is a bell nearer than the
mines. I guess I must have imagined it, that is
all. Well, it is growing dark. Shall we separate
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we might as well,&rdquo; the others agreed.</p>
<p>With mutual goodbyes and agreeing to meet again
at the grove in which they were at present stopped,
the four boys split into two groups and went in opposite
directions. Terry and Jim rode north and up
the mountain, and Ned and Don began to make their
way south, moving up the mountain on a gradual
slant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny about that bell,&rdquo; Ned said, as they rode
slowly forward. &ldquo;I could have sworn to it that I
heard a bell ringing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a bell?&rdquo; asked Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounded like a church bell, and it seemed to be
tolling. But I guess it was some other sounds that
I mistook. Certainly there is no church anywhere
around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look as though there is,&rdquo; grinned Don.</p>
<p>The sun had now set on the other side of the giant
range and they were in total darkness. Knowing
that it would be useless to push on very rapidly during
the night they planned to put up a temporary
camp on some ridge and wait there until daylight
came. That would give them a few hours to look
around before returning to their meeting place to
compare notes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we might as well camp and eat,&rdquo; Ned
suggested, and they found a spot that was dry and
sheltered, where they speedily kindled a small fire
and made some coffee. Sandwiches went with it
and then they settled down beside the fire, talking
quietly and keeping both ears and eyes open for any
strange sound. It was early when they turned in
and slept soundly.</p>
<p>How long they had been asleep was a matter of
conjecture, but they were shocked into a state of
wakefulness by the furious tolling of a bell. It was
near at hand, and they leaped to their feet with
rapidly beating hearts. Alone there on the mountain
fastness the sound was awe-inspiring and unpleasantly
thrilling, and both boys felt chills running up
and down their backs. The bell which was ringing so
mysteriously was not more than a hundred feet
from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness, what in the name of glory is that!&rdquo;
gasped Ned, as the horses moved restlessly back and
forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bell,&rdquo; cried Don, snatching up his rifle.
&ldquo;We were camped almost on top of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned secured his weapon. &ldquo;Never mind the horses,
let&rsquo;s see what is up,&rdquo; he shouted. They started on
a run in the direction of the sound of the bell, breaking
recklessly through the undergrowth. In less than
a hundred yards they emerged into a clearing and
came upon the ruins of a castle, in the tower of
which the bell was tolling madly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>A man stood in a doorway, a faint light behind
him. He had seen them coming and shouted something
to someone within. The bell ceased to toll
and the boys pressed on, straight for the figure in
the doorway. It was joined by another and Ned
raised a shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sackett!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll find dad now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His answer was a shot from Sackett&rsquo;s revolver,
and they threw themselves flat on the ground, to
send two high shots whistling through the narrow
doorway. Had Sackett and Abel known that they
were alone the two outlaws would not have run,
but they were unable to make out anything accurate
against the black trees and thought that a full party
had arrived. The two men did not linger, but
made their way out over the ruins of the first floor
and escaped the boys hearing them take to their
horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t take dad with them,&rdquo; cried Ned,
leaping to his feet. &ldquo;He must be in the house yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered the castle, to find a candle in a
bottle giving light to the single good room which
remained of the ruins. Seeing the door in the side
of the wall Ned and Don made for it, the former
taking up the candle as they did so. They had no
more fear of the bandits and they fairly ran down
the stairs, to find Professor Scott waiting at the
barred door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; cried Ned in delight. &ldquo;So you are really
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and I thought I&rsquo;d be here for sometime,&rdquo;
smiled Mr. Scott. &ldquo;You boys arrived just
in time. How did you like my bell concert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that we might never have
found you,&rdquo; said Ned. He broke the padlock with
the butt of his gun, and then stepped hastily back.
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dark figure was worming through the hole in
the wall of the dungeon. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; the
professor said cheerfully. &ldquo;It is Yappi, who is joining
the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The padlock was broken off, the door opened and
Ned and his father embraced warmly. He shook
Don by the hand and after hasty explanations had
been made they followed Yappi up the stairs. The
mestizo had refused to accept any thanks and took
the lead in getting them out of the place.</p>
<p>They made a hasty search but found nothing of
importance. The men had escaped on their mounts,
and it was useless to think of following them. Yappi
took them to the mouth of the underground passage
and showed them how to drop down in it, and
they walked along it back to the dungeon and then
once more went back to the courtyard before the
castle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;The rascals either took my horse or loosed it,&rdquo;
said the professor. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to walk home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, senor,&rdquo; said Yappi, quietly. &ldquo;I have
provide for that. Two horses in yonder bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he went to the thicket indicated and led out
two horses. They praised his foresight lavishly but he
was indifferent to their praises. Ned then proposed
that they go back to the meeting place.</p>
<p>Accordingly they mounted and went down the
mountain to the place where they had left Terry
and Jim. It was decided to wait until morning for
the other two, rather than fire off their guns to attract
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should be here at seven in the morning,
and it won&rsquo;t be long before it is that time,&rdquo; Don
said. &ldquo;So we might as well wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they waited, sleeping by turns, waking at last
to greet a fine warm day. Seven o&rsquo;clock came and
passed and no sign of the others was to be seen.
When a half hour had passed they began to fire their
guns at intervals, but there was nothing but silence
after the echoes had broken in different places over
the mountain sides.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Refusing to be worried over it they ate breakfast
and again fired their guns, riding out from
their camp for a few miles in either direction. But
when ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning came they once
more assembled in the camp and faced the bitter
facts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ned, in despair. &ldquo;Now those fellows
are gone. They must have become lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either that,&rdquo; said Don, gravely. &ldquo;Or they have
fallen into the hands of Sackett!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">A FORCED MARCH</span></h2>
<p>Terry and Jim had made their way northward
and up the mountain. It was growing dark and
they wished to cover as much ground as possible
before the night would make their task difficult.
They planned to seek some high point and camp
there, watching the mountain sides for a sign of a
fire or light of any kind. With this in mind they
pushed steadily on, winding up the sloping side of
the range.</p>
<p>When darkness finally came on they pitched camp,
a process that consisted of very little else than getting
off their horses and building a fire. There was
a chill in the air which made them glad of the
small fire, and they ate a hearty supper beside it,
discussing the business at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we find that nothing has been discovered,&rdquo;
said Jim, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to beat up the mountain in
deadly earnest in the morning. We&rsquo;re satisfied that
they didn&rsquo;t go toward the sea, but we must take care
that they haven&rsquo;t skipped out of these mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; agreed the red-headed boy, as
he poured out coffee, &ldquo;but there must be a million
hiding places in these mountains, and we&rsquo;ll have to
draw mighty fine lines. I suppose there is no use
of going any further tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so,&rdquo; rejoined Jim, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know the country and we may run into
some trouble. We are on a knoll here and should
be able to see any light that would show on the
mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose someone should see our fire?&rdquo; asked
Terry, practically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much danger of that,&rdquo; said Jim.
&ldquo;The fire is small and we are up pretty high. When
we go to sleep the fire will die down and probably
go out. We can comb a few miles of the woods
before we go back to meet Don and Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the meal was over the boys cleaned up
around their camp site and stood for some time on
the crest of the rise looking down into the blackness
of the forest below them. There was no sign of
life in the dense trees and no light was to be seen.
Jim and Terry once more seriously considered the
possibility of making a night search and then finally
decided against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly am sleepy,&rdquo; yawned Terry, as they
made their way back to the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as soon as we gather some wood we&rsquo;ll
turn in,&rdquo; suggested Jim. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it is
necessary to keep the fire going all night, but we
will have wood at hand for the first thing in the
morning so that we can build a fire without wasting
any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With their knives and their hands the two boys
gathered enough wood to last them for several hours
and then gave a final look at the horses. Then
each of them took his blanket from the pile of equipment,
stacked his gun alongside, loosened shoes and
neckties and rolled up in the blankets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If either one of us wakes up he can put wood
on the fire,&rdquo; said Terry, as he settled himself in
the blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t wake up purposely,&rdquo; advised
Jim.</p>
<p>They went to sleep without any trouble, being
pretty well tired from the day&rsquo;s journey. The air
was cool and fresh and they were healthy young
men, so they slept soundly. Terry was perhaps the
lighter sleeper of the two, and it was he who shook
Jim into wakefulness after they had been asleep for
a few hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is up?&rdquo; asked Jim, awaking swiftly, his
brain working perfectly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen and see if you don&rsquo;t hear a bell ringing!&rdquo;
whispered Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Jim listened, and in spite of himself he felt his
flesh quiver. The mountain was dark, the wind fitful,
and the fire was a dull red. From off in the
distance the sound of a bell was heard, a bell that
clashed and rang without rhythm. The sound was
far away and very faint, and when the wind blew
with a slight increase in force they lost the sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; murmured Jim, propped on his
elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose it is?&rdquo; whispered Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea. I don&rsquo;t know where
there could be a bell around here. It might be
possible that there is a village nearby and for some
reason or other they are ringing the town bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. Shall we go down, follow the sound,
and see what it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we should,&rdquo; Jim argued. &ldquo;It
might simply be a wild goose chase. The sound is
coming from the south, and maybe Ned and Don
will investigate. I guess we had better stay where
we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you are right,&rdquo; Terry agreed, throwing
some wood on the fire. &ldquo;Back to sleep we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim followed Terry&rsquo;s advice. The red-headed boy
dozed and woke up, staring at the sky and moving
restlessly. The sound of the bell had stopped and
he closed his eyes and once more dozed off. He
had slept lightly for perhaps an hour when he woke
up, his senses alert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>There had been a sound near the camp. The
horses were moving restlessly and Terry raised himself
on his elbow and looked into the shadows. The
fire had burned low again and he could not see
far. He debated whether to wake Jim or not, and
then decided not to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting jumpy,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I must go to
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at that moment two shadows moved quickly
from the tall trees and toward the fire. With a
warning shout to Jim, Terry rolled out of his blanket
and reached for the nearby guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave your hands off them guns!&rdquo; snarled
Sackett, as Jim kicked his way clear of his coverings.</p>
<p>Terry looked once at the two outlaws and the
guns which they had in their hands and decided to
give in. Jim scrambled to his feet and stood beside
him, dismayed at the turn events had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A couple of bad pennies turned up,&rdquo; muttered
Terry, inwardly angry at the new developments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All those kids weren&rsquo;t together,&rdquo; said Abel, aside
to Sackett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see they weren&rsquo;t. Well, we&rsquo;ll take these
youngsters along,&rdquo; replied the leader, taking their
guns from the tree where they were leaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with us?&rdquo; Jim demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out soon enough,&rdquo; retorted Sackett.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;You meddling kids made us lose the old man so
we&rsquo;ll just take you along for a little ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned and Don must have rescued the professor,&rdquo;
said Jim to Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never mind what happened!&rdquo; growled Abel,
in such a manner that they knew their guess was
correct. &ldquo;Get your horses and come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you taking us?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind your own business,&rdquo; snapped Sackett.
&ldquo;Gather up your junk and hurry up about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; nodded Terry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going somewhere
and it isn&rsquo;t any of my business where! And Jimmy,
my boy, all this nice equipment that Ned gave us
is just junk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit your talking,&rdquo; commanded Abel. &ldquo;We have
no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In silence the two boys gathered up the blankets
and the camping kits, strapped them on the horse
under the watchful eye of the mate, and then
mounted. Sackett whistled and Manuel appeared,
leading three horses. The outlaws sprang into the
saddle and Abel took the lead, the other two hemming
in the boys from the rear. Abel turned his
horse&rsquo;s head down the mountain and toward the
sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too doggone bad we didn&rsquo;t keep a sharper lookout,&rdquo;
Terry grumbled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Jim shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Perhaps, but I
don&rsquo;t know. These fellows were running from Don
and Ned, and their falling in on us was an accident.
We&rsquo;ll have to keep our eyes open and see if we can
give them the slip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horses picked their way down the mountain
expertly, and they had worked several miles to the
southward before they rode out on the open plain.
Daylight was now not far off, and they went on in
silence, both parties keenly awake to the slightest
movement of the other. When daylight did break
over the plain they were miles from the mountain
and almost to the sea. There had been no chance
to make a break and Terry and Jim resigned themselves
to their fate.</p>
<p>No halt was made to eat, and the boys found that
they were very hungry and somewhat tired. What
little sleep they had had was only enough to refresh
them sufficiently to keep going, and they would have
liked to lay down and enjoy a full, untroubled sleep.
But they knew that if they were ever to escape
from Sackett and his men they must be on the
alert every minute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>They rode steadily onward, the men apparently
indifferent to the thought of breakfast and the boys
grimly uncomplaining. Jim was more used to a
horse than Terry and did not mind the ride, but
the red-headed boy was growing restless. From
time to time the men looked back at the distant
mountains, but as they were now many miles below
the vicinity of the ruined castle there was nothing
to be feared from the other party. The sea was
now very near and Jim thought he recognized the
country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken we rode over this country
yesterday,&rdquo; he said aside to Terry.</p>
<p>Before them at a distance of less than a mile, was
a high bluff, and when they rode to the edge of
this bluff the boys saw a familiar sight. Directly
below them was the tannery which they had stopped
to inspect on the day before. It was at this point
that the Mexican slipped out and took the lead,
showing them a steep and winding path that ran
down beside the cliff and led to the beach below.
Down this the party made its way, the nimble horses
bracing their feet expertly, and after some twenty
minutes of steady descending they emerged at length
onto the hard sand of the beach.</p>
<p>Manuel still kept the lead, riding up to the tannery,
and at one of the smaller sheds he alighted
from his horse, an example which was followed by
the others. The boys were not sorry to follow suit
and when they had done so Manuel took the horses
and lodged them out of sight in the main building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; demanded Terry. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you fellows
any stomachs? I&rsquo;m starved!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Sackett opened the door to the smaller building
with a grin on his ugly face. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all hungry,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Abel, cook up some grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while them kids are here,&rdquo; said the mate,
promptly. &ldquo;Let them do the cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too hungry to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; just now,&rdquo; said Jim,
promptly. &ldquo;Somebody get me wood and I&rsquo;ll make
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abel brought wood while Manuel went up the
bluff and disappeared. Sackett sat on a ledge near
the door, keeping a watchful eye on the boys. Jim
cooked an excellent breakfast and the men enjoyed
it. Manuel had come back and reported briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship&rsquo;s coming in,&rdquo; he said in Spanish, but the
boys understood him.</p>
<p>Just as the meal was over the Mexican looked
out of the door and got up. &ldquo;The boat is in,&rdquo; he
said to Sackett.</p>
<p>The leader arose quickly and motioned to the
boys. &ldquo;Come on, you boys, we&rsquo;re moving. Abel,
bring up in the rear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; Jim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out when you get on board,&rdquo; retorted
Sackett, as he marched them out of the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently on a ship,&rdquo; murmured Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>He was right. Off the shore a battered old
schooner with two masts was tossing gently to and
fro and near them on the beach a long boat was
hauled up, with its crew of six waiting. The men
touched their caps when Sackett approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in the boat,&rdquo; ordered Sackett, and the boys
climbed in, taking their places in the stern seats.
The outlaws followed, all but Manuel, who stood
on the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the horses back to the hide-out,&rdquo; Sackett
said to the Mexican. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back soon.&rdquo; To
the boat&rsquo;s crew, who had taken their places at the
oars he said, &ldquo;Row us alongside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crew pulled with a will and the boat moved
from the shore, out onto the blue waters of the
Pacific. After a row of a half mile they ranged
alongside of the schooner, which had the name
<i>Galloway</i> painted on the stern. Jim and Terry were
ordered up the side ladder, where they dropped over
the rail to the deck. Sackett and Abel, followed by
the crew, speedily joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put on sail,&rdquo; ordered Sackett of the ship&rsquo;s captain,
as that officer approached. He turned to the
boys, a grin of evil delight on his face. &ldquo;You
kids wanted to know where you are going, eh?
Well, we&rsquo;re taking you to Mexico, to keep you
prisoners on a nice, deserted ranch until it suits us
to let you go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">HISTORY REPEATS</span></h2>
<p>For a moment after Sackett made his startling
statement the two boys could only stand and stare
at him. At last Jim spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are taking us to Mexico?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; mocked the outlaw. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford
to have you two boys hanging around while we are
looking for that treasure. So we are going to put
you in cold storage for a time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mexico isn&rsquo;t exactly cold storage,&rdquo; murmured
Terry. &ldquo;Bum joker, this Sackett man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out it ain&rsquo;t a joke,&rdquo; said Sackett, as
the sails were run into place. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a long time
before you boys get home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll run into a lot of trouble over this,&rdquo; Jim
warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble is something I&rsquo;m used to,&rdquo; Sackett
grinned. He turned to the villainous-looking captain
of the schooner. &ldquo;Captain Jake Ryan, keep
your eyes on these boys and put them ashore where
I tell you. I&rsquo;m going ashore at Peso myself, so I
make you responsible for them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid they&rsquo;ll get away from
me,&rdquo; the captain growled, looking them over keenly.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re nothing but kids!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they&rsquo;re pretty slippery ones,&rdquo; warned
Sackett. &ldquo;Come down in the cabin with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men, followed by Abel, left the boys
and walked off. Jim looked at Terry and the latter
shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like we&rsquo;re in for it now,&rdquo; the red-headed
boy remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we are,&rdquo; Jim replied, in a low voice.
&ldquo;But we must get away. If we are carried to
Mexico there is no telling when we will ever get
home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough, but I don&rsquo;t recommend starting
anything with this crew,&rdquo; said Terry.</p>
<p>The crew was indeed a rough looking outfit, apparently
picked up in many ports and composed of
rascals of every sort. They wore no uniforms and
were seemingly expert in their trade, by which sign
the boys took it that they had spent most of their
life on board sailing vessels. They represented different
nationalities and were a hardy and bold set
of men, who would not stop at any kind of trade
so long as it promised them gain of some sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet the police of many a town would like
to see these fellows,&rdquo; was Jim&rsquo;s estimate of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The ship was rapidly leaving that portion of the
coast where Jim and Terry had come aboard and
was heading south. That meant that they intended
to round off the tip of Lower California and run
up the shore of Mexico, probably in one of the
wildest portions of the tropical country. The boys
looked once or twice over the side, but they knew
it would be foolish to jump over, since they would
be shot or overtaken by a boat before reaching the
shore. There was nothing left for them to do,
therefore, but to make the best of the situation.</p>
<p>They wandered over the deck of the schooner,
forgetting in their interest that they were captives.
Jim and Terry had done enough sailing to know
something about sailing ships, and this ancient
schooner interested them greatly. It had evidently
been in active service for years, for it was battered
and beaten by many storms and its decks were worn
deeply in spots. The vast expanse of sails overhead,
close hauled in the wind, drew their eyes in admiration,
even though the sails were dirty and
patched. The crew worked busily around the rigging,
coiling ropes and stowing loose equipment, paying
no attention to the boys, much as though taking
prisoners was an every-day affair with them. The
boys noted that two of the men worked apart from
the main crew and looked to be men of a better
stamp than the rank and file.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>After a short run down the coast a tiny village
appeared on the coast and once opposite it Sackett
and the mate appeared on deck. The town was
that of Peso and the captain of the <i>Galloway</i>
ordered the boat over the side. Sackett and Abel
entered the boat and then looked up to where Jim
and Terry leaned over the rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, boys,&rdquo; mocked the bay pirate. &ldquo;If
we run across the other members of your party
we&rsquo;ll give them your regards, shall we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim only glowered, but Terry raised his slouched
camping hat. &ldquo;Why Mr. Sackett!&rdquo; he exclaimed
sweetly. &ldquo;How very lovely of you! If I were only
nearer to you I would kiss your sweet face for that
kind thought!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crew of the <i>Galloway</i> broke into broad
grins and the captain chuckled. Sackett&rsquo;s face grew
red and he half rose from his seat in the long boat.
But Abel pulled him down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit fooling with those kids and let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; he
said, and Sackett sat down, after saying something
fiery through his set teeth. The sailors pulled on
their oars and the long boat shot through the water
to the shore. When the two men had been set on
shore the boat returned, and the schooner continued
on its way.</p>
<p>Up to that time the air had been clear and the
water untroubled, but a change gradually developed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>A slight haze sprang up over the water and the
air became thicker. Little choppy waves began to
form, and before long the schooner was beginning
to rock with increasing force.</p>
<p>In the bow there was a commotion. A lookout
in the crow&rsquo;s nest had called something down, and
the captain came hurrying on deck. The boys soon
discovered a large black schooner to the west of
them, some four miles off, and the sight of it appeared
to alarm the crew. Acting under orders
from the captain they crowded on more sail and
began to run before the wind. It was a move that
was not particularly wise under the increasing
strength of the rising wind, and the two boys were
puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terry,&rdquo; said Jim, as he stood in the stern watching
the schooner in the distance. &ldquo;These fellows are
running away from that ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry looked with increasing interest and found
that Jim was right. The schooner behind them was
also crowding on sail, heeling over in the wind but
running toward them in a direct line. The crew of
the <i>Galloway</i> was now fully on the alert and obeying
the shouted orders of the skipper. The two
men who had attracted the attention of the boys
by their difference in looks compared to the rest
of the motley crew, looked eagerly toward the oncoming
schooner until they were literally driven to
work by Captain Ryan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>As may be imagined the boys watched the chase
with an interest that was painful. The outcome of
it meant everything to them. They had no idea who
could be on the pursuing schooner, but whoever it
was would be sure to release them if they overhauled
the <i>Galloway</i>. When the crew of the schooner
ran out a small cannon Terry whistled in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no comedy,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;These fellows
mean business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sky to the south had turned an ominous black
and the wind was now shrieking through the shrouds
of the schooner. Cursing aloud Ryan ordered sail
taken in, and the crew sprang aloft, running along
the ropes in a way that took away the breath of the
watching boys. The oncoming schooner was also
forced to take in canvas but it did not give up the
chase. The waves, an hour ago, so calm and peaceful,
were now mountain high, raging and boiling
along the sides of the laboring ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;History repeats itself!&rdquo; exclaimed Jim, suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; blinked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s just like the story of the galleon! We
are being pursued by an enemy and a storm is
surely going to close over us! See the point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. Confound this storm, anyway! If
it wasn&rsquo;t for it I believe those fellows in back would
overtake us!&rdquo; cried Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw a storm come up so rapidly,&rdquo; said
Jim.</p>
<p>In that part of the Pacific storms rise with incredible
swiftness and it was such a storm, half
cyclonic, as now burst over the pursued and the
pursuer. In a twinkling of an eye the ship to the
rear vanished from sight as the <i>Galloway</i> staggered
into a yawning trough. The boys had all
they could do to hang on as the deck slanted under
their feet, and they were soaked to the waist by
the wash that flooded the deck. A single slashing
flash of lightening flared in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we had better go below, so as not
to be washed overboard?&rdquo; shouted Terry above the
whine of the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; roared Jim, his voice sounding
like a whisper above the crash of the waves. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t miss this for anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they hung on to the rear mast and the ropes,
keenly alive to the picture of action which was going
on before them. They could see the men busy
at the sails, pulling ropes, furling, lashing fast and
jumping as the skipper signalled his commands. They
had been forgotten in the excitement of the storm,
and so were free to watch what was going on.
They knew that the pursuing schooner would never
haul down on them now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>The captain was at the wheel helping the helmsman,
and between the two of them they could
scarcely control the wild plunging of the schooner.
The boys watched with fascination as wave after
wave reared up before the schooner, to curl and
break over the bow and come thundering over the
deck in a mad swirl. At such times they were wet
to the waist but they did not mind that, so interested
were they in the events of the moment. Their
hands ached from holding onto ropes but they stuck
to their perilous post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are running in too close to the shore!&rdquo;
shouted Terry in Jim&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should know the coast well enough to do
it,&rdquo; Jim returned.</p>
<p>He had scarcely spoken when there was a slight
scraping and grinding sound and the men at the
wheel spun the helm rapidly. The <i>Galloway</i> swung
further away from the shore, listing dangerously
as it did so. One of the crew ran down the companionway
and reappeared soon afterward, making
his way to the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She scraped a ledge that time,&rdquo; called Jim and
Terry nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>It was now so black that the boys could scarcely
see before them. The captain spoke rapidly with
the man, who was the mate, and the officer quickly
singled one or two men from the crew and then
made his way over the bounding lurching deck to
the boys. Placing his wet mouth near their ears he
shouted: &ldquo;Get on the pumps! We&rsquo;re leaking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without loss of time the boys followed him
across the deck to where the pumps were located.
Two men had already seized the handle of one pump
and were bending their backs to the task, pumping
up and down with all their strength. At a signal
from the mate the two boys took hold of the handle
of a second pump and fell to the urgent task.</p>
<p>A thick stream of water shot out of the end of
the pump and they knew that the lower part of the
schooner was filling rapidly with water. It seemed
to them that there was no use in pumping, but they
realized that it was their only chance. No life-boat
could live in those seas and it was a case of keep
the ship from going down under their feet under the
added weight of the water that was pouring into
the hold, where a seam had been opened up by the
ledge over which they had scraped. So they worked
with a will, moving the handle up and down, until
their backs, totally unused to the work, ached with
the tiring strain of it. A continual stream of water
rushed from the mouth of the pump with every
stroke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>They were soon gasping for breath and both of
them longed for the moment when two other men
would relieve them. The two on the other pump
kept at it grimly, somewhat more used to the work,
moving automatically, unmindful of the stinging
waves that slapped them from each side. The
schooner pitched and rolled and bucked, now on top
of a wave and now sinking deep into a trough.</p>
<p>To their unspeakable relief they saw two more
men approach with the mate to take over their task.
The captain had realized that they would not last
long at the cruel task, and had sent relief. The men
were coming toward them, were almost to them.</p>
<p>There was a sharp grinding sound and the
schooner crashed hard aground. Every man who was
standing went over like a stick of wood. Down came
the rigging in a tumbled, confused mass, the forward
mast snapped off sharp, the bow seemed to
crumple like paper. Terry and Jim were torn from
the pump handle and hurled through the air, to land
like playthings in a smother of foam and swirling
water. All became black in an instant, there was a
sucking sound and the schooner settled down in the
water with a shudder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">THE MOUNTAIN SAGE</span></h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;s grave statement to the effect that Jim and
Terry might have fallen into the hands of Sackett
was received with a gloomy degree of conviction by
the others. They knew that the outlaws had fled
somewhere across the mountains, and it was very
likely that they had run across the trail of the two
boys in their flight. The professor spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must lose no time in following them,&rdquo; he
declared, with spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of us will follow them,&rdquo; said Ned.
&ldquo;You had better go back to the ranch, dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I go back?&rdquo; demanded the professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be tired. You had a long ride yesterday
and didn&rsquo;t sleep much last night. You and
Yappi go back to the ranch and we&rsquo;ll push on after
Jim and Terry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with you,&rdquo; declared the professor,
stoutly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no child! Don&rsquo;t you think I have
any interest in finding the boys and running this
gang down? I would be mighty restless back on the
ranch. So let&rsquo;s start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some further discussion they struck off in
the direction last taken by the missing boys and rode
up the mountain, keeping a careful lookout as they
did so. They spread out in fan fashion, keeping
close enough together so as to call back and forth.
It was sometime in the afternoon when Yappi called
out and the others closed in and joined him.</p>
<p>The mestizo was off his horse, standing close to
the ashes of a fire which had evidently been out for
some hours. They were all of the opinion that Terry
and Jim had built the fire and had spent the night
beside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question is now where they went from here,&rdquo;
mused the professor.</p>
<p>Ned was searching the nearby bushes and he set
up a shout. &ldquo;There were others here last night, too,&rdquo;
he announced.</p>
<p>Upon inspection they found the bushes beaten
down by the hoofs of horses, but at first Don was
not convinced. &ldquo;This is probably where they tied
up their own horses,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Other horse over here,&rdquo; replied the mestizo,
gravely.</p>
<p>On the other side of the clearing they found the
traces of other horses. There had been two parties,
or else one spot marked the location of the missing
boys&rsquo; horses and the other that of the second
party. The professor was sure that Sackett and
his men had come down on them in the night while
they slept. And later all doubt was laid aside when
Ned found a big foot print in the soft sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither Jim nor Terry made that,&rdquo; he said, with
conviction.</p>
<p>The others agreed with him, and by careful tracing
they found that the party had gone down the
mountain toward the sea. They followed the trail
for at least a half mile and then lost it on some
rocky ground, but they were satisfied that they were
on the right track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are heading for the sea,&rdquo; Ned said. &ldquo;Perhaps
they have some kind of a boat down there.
Well, we might as well get right on the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a bad storm coming up,&rdquo; cried Don.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>The sun had long since been lost in a slow gloom
which had come in from the sea, and the air was
hot and still. Heavy black clouds were rolling in
from the south, and there was an almost ominous
stillness in the air. Far away they heard the low
rolling of thunder off at sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a bad one,&rdquo; admitted Ned, as he
studied the sky. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have many storms in
this region, but when we do get one it generally
amounts to something. Well, we&rsquo;ll push on until
we have to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had gone perhaps a mile along the mountain,
working down toward the sea, when the leaves of
the trees began to stir with increasing force.
Secretly, Ned was worried, for he knew the strength
of some of the storms his country was subject to,
and he would have welcomed some sort of shelter.
Just as he was beginning to think it best that they
find shelter in the lee of some big rock Yappi called
to him in Spanish. The ranchman had sighted an
Indian hut just before them in the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>They rode up to the place, to find a withered old
Yuqui Indian sitting on a crude bench at his door.
He was engaged at the task of weaving a basket,
and he looked up unemotionally as they drew up
before his door. The hut back of him was a simple
round affair, made of rough wood held together
with a clay filling, which showed between the logs.
Two windows, neatly glassed with glass which had
been procured in some town nearby, and a single
door alone broke the monotonous expanse of rough
wood. A single chimney protruded from the top of
the hut.</p>
<p>At a nod from Ned Yappi addressed the Indian
in his native dialect, but it turned out that the
Yuqui was very familiar with Spanish. Yappi told
him that they wished shelter during the oncoming
storm, and the old man, without showing pleasure
or displeasure on his lined old face, replied that
what he had they were welcome to. No sooner had
he finished his statement than the rain began to
descend in torrents.</p>
<p>The white men slipped from their horses quickly,
Yappi took the bridles and led the horses to the
shelter of a nearby leanto which the Indian had,
and the whole party entered the hut. The Indian
slipped in before them and was heaping wood on
the small fire which burned in his fireplace, and as
the flames shot up they had time to look around the
hut. It was an interesting place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>There was a woven mat on the floor, a bed in one
corner, and a rough table and chair in the center of
the room. On the wall was hung a splendid bow and
a sheaf of arrows, several baskets such as the one
which the Yuqui had been weaving, and an Indian
headdress. That portion of the floor which was
not covered with a mat was neatly carpeted with
leaves. The fireplace was constructed of hard clay.
The entire hut was neat and orderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strangers are welcome,&rdquo; said the Indian, as
he sat beside the fire.</p>
<p>Ned thanked him gravely and for a few moments
nothing more was said. They sat and listened to
the fury of the storm outside. The wind hissed
and slapped against the windows and the sides of
the hut, the wind moaned overhead and the sky had
become inky black. Don was worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Jim and Terry aren&rsquo;t anywhere exposed
in this storm,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Ned hastened to assure him.
&ldquo;Those fellows know the sign as well as we do, and
they must have dug for shelter. The fellows are
all right, and we&rsquo;ll hit the trail as soon as we
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian was looking at them earnestly, and the
professor, who could speak Spanish quite well, took
it upon himself to tell him the circumstances. The
old man listened intently and then nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a sage,&rdquo; he said proudly. &ldquo;I tell you
that you shall find them. Yengi is my name.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>The visitors were silent, not knowing how to
take this abrupt declaration. Yappi talked rapidly
with the sage and seemed impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yengi is a wise man,&rdquo; he told Ned. &ldquo;What he
says is true. Long has he dwelt in these mountains,
and his ancestors dwelt here before he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian sage nodded and addressed the whole
party. &ldquo;He speaks truth. For many generations
my people have lived in this land. But not here in
this mountain. I live here alone. My people lived
far to the south, on a broad plain, until the people
in beautiful clothes came. Those were the Spanish.
They drove some of our people into slavery and
killed others, and because we were few in number
we were compelled to flee to the mountains and
hide like wild beasts. My fathers told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire had died down, the storm still beat outside,
and the white men were silent as they listened
to the simple but tragic story of the Indian sage. They
knew that his tale was only too true, for they had
read many times of such things, the professor being
well versed in the history of the Spanish conquest
of the southern part of America. It was a
moving experience to hear it now from the lips of
a descendent of the persecuted race that suffered so
many centuries ago. Ned, the professor and Yappi
understood perfectly what the sage was saying, and
Don knew enough of Spanish to follow him without
trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>The professor was smoking his pipe, so the sage
reached into a niche beside the fireplace, took out a
long crude Indian pipe and gravely lighted it. He
smoked awhile in silence and then went on: &ldquo;But
my fathers had revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one said anything and he puffed once or twice
and then went on: &ldquo;The English were our saviors.
They chased the Spanish from our coasts. But I
spoke to you about the revenge that my fathers took.
One day in the long ago there was a storm and a
Spanish ship fled from the English and was wrecked
somewhere on the coast. I do not know where, but
the men from the ship came straggling past our
hidden village in the fastness of the mountain. My
fathers saw them and ambushed them, slaying all of
them, allowing only a priest to go free. He had
been kind to some Indians once and his life was
spared. He had with him a book and he was led
to the sea coast, where he took ship to Mexico and
was never seen more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yengi looked up as there was a stir among his
hearers, and he was astonished to see them regarding
him eagerly. He took his pipe out of his mouth
in astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;These men that your fathers killed came from a
wrecked ship?&rdquo; asked the professor eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so they told my fathers. Why does that
excite you so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned told the sage that they knew the story of
the wrecked galleon and that there was supposed to
be much treasure in the wrecked ship. The Indian
was sure that the men must have come from that
very ship, but beyond that he was not helpful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know where the ship could be,&rdquo; he
told them. &ldquo;The men, with the exception of the
priest with the book, were all killed. They never
went back, but the priest may have returned for the
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as the priest had a book, that must
surely have been the crew,&rdquo; said Don.</p>
<p>But the professor shook his head. &ldquo;The book
which the priest had may have been his own Bible,
or some other book. It couldn&rsquo;t have been the
written story of the wreck, for you must remember
that it was written after the storm and wreck and
after the men were killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; nodded Don, somewhat cast down. &ldquo;But
you have no doubt that it was the galleon&rsquo;s crew,
have you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, none at all,&rdquo; returned the professor.
&ldquo;The story is too closely allied to the one we know
to be at all doubtful. It seems to me that if we can
get the Indian here to take us to the spot where
the crew was killed that would be somewhere near
where the galleon struck. At least, we would be in
the immediate neighborhood, and not all at sea, as
we are now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about losing time in the hunt for the
boys?&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get some idea of the location and then
push on after the boys,&rdquo; said the professor. He
turned to the Yuqui and asked him if he would lead
them to the spot where the men from the ship were
killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen the place,&rdquo; nodded the Indian. &ldquo;I
will show it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we find the treasure through your help we
will give you a share of it,&rdquo; promised Ned.</p>
<p>The Indian waved his hand impatiently. &ldquo;Gold
is cursed,&rdquo; he said, sternly. &ldquo;Yengi has wisdom,
which is more than gold. I wish none of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>The party was impatient to start out but when
night came on the storm had abated but little and
they accepted the Indian&rsquo;s invitation to stay with
him all night. They ate together and sat around
the fire talking, the Indian telling them many more
stories of his race in their glory, himself astonished
at the learning of the professor. He found it hard
to believe that the professor had learned so much
from books.</p>
<p>At last they lay down and wrapped themselves
in their blankets, Don breathing a prayer for the
safety of his brother and his chum before they
fell asleep. It had been agreed that they would
leave early in the morning to look at the spot where
the old Indian village had stood and from there
they would push on to the sea in the search for the
missing boys. Yengi, who knew the country much
better than even Yappi did, was to go with them and
lend his valuable aid. With many varied conjectures
in their minds as to what the morrow would bring
forth the whole party soon became quiet in sleep,
the professor very nearly exhausted by the events
of the past two days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">THE LANDING PARTY</span></h2>
<p>When the morning dawned the party was not
slow to spring into action, but quick as they were
their host was up before them. He was preparing
breakfast at the fire and greeted them with quiet
dignity. Before eating Ned and Don looked outside,
to find a day somewhat better than the one
before it had been, but still showing the effects of
the storm. Sullen gray clouds passed overhead,
impelled by the wind which was driving forward
steadily, and the ground was still muddy from the
rain which had fallen heavily. They were certain
to escape the exhausting heat which had lately hindered
them, and thankful for this circumstance the
boys went in and enjoyed Yengi&rsquo;s breakfast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>The horses were saddled and without loss of time
the company set out. The Indian closed his door
but did not lock it, saying that no one would be
likely to enter his place during his absence. They
struck off to the south, following the sage and
Yappi, who rode well to the front.</p>
<p>The horses found the going a little difficult, as
the ground was slippery, and the men soaked their
trouser legs as they scraped past bushes and small
shrubs. This condition of affairs did not last long,
for they soon rode down out of the mountains and
reached the level plain. Here the going was much
better and they went off at a brisk trot, heading for
a furrowed section of uplands which they could see
some miles before them.</p>
<p>During the journey they kept a sharp look-out
for their missing companions, but no sign was seen
of any living being as they went on. One or two
large jack-rabbits crossed their path and Yappi
brought one down, stowing it in a bag behind his
saddle for some future meal. The act was opportune,
for they had now run out of provisions and would
have to depend in the future on whatever they
brought down with their guns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Don was in a curious state of mind as they travelled
on. He was anxious about Jim and Terry, and
the thought that he might be going further away
from them with each mile was not a pleasing one.
But they had no definite clue as to the whereabouts
of the others, and one direction was as good as another.
All of them felt that they had made for the
coast, but just where on the coast they had no idea.
It was simply a matter of keeping going, and watching
carefully for the slightest sign which would
send them in the right direction.</p>
<p>Before noon they arrived at the place where the
old Indian village had been and where the Spanish
crew, probably from the galleon, had been killed.
The village had stood in a slight basin, hidden in a
convenient roll of the sheltering foothills, and there
was now but little to tell that there had ever been
a village there. All trace of the huts which had
once been there was lost, but several places in the
hills, hollowed out of the volcanic dykes, showed
that someone had once lived there. Some low mounds
marked the burial places of the ancient Indians.</p>
<p>The sage pointed to the south. &ldquo;From that direction
the men came,&rdquo; he said, his dull eyes kindling
as he thought of the glory of his former race. &ldquo;The
village in which my fathers lived was originally
there, but they lived here in order to flee into the
mountains when the Spaniards came. It was here
that the crew of the great ship were killed, and
afterward my people scattered, leaving a few of my
race in the hills and the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>They looked around the spot with interest and
discussed the possibilities. Some miles east of them
lay the sea, and Ned argued that the creek up which
the galleon had sailed could not be far off. He would
have liked to have set out for it at once, but realizing
that the task of finding the missing boys was of
far greater importance he smothered his desire, resolved
to return some day and strike off from that
spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Spaniards were evidently heading for the
mountains at the time that they fell into the hands
of the Indians,&rdquo; the professor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should they head for the mountains?&rdquo; Don
asked. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t they have been more likely to
have kept to the shore, in the hope of being picked
up by another ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; replied the professor. &ldquo;They
may have intended to make their way over the
mountains to Mexico, or they may have feared the
Indians with good cause, for their cruelties made
the Indians eager to lay hands on them. Probably
they feared the very thing that did befall them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now that we have at least marked the
portion of the country where the crew appeared, let&rsquo;s
get on,&rdquo; suggested Ned. &ldquo;In all my searching I
fell short of this region by a good twenty-five miles,
and this will help me get my bearings. Evidently
the spot of the wreck is still some miles to the south,
but I think we should be able to come across it when
we have more leisure to look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your thought?&rdquo; inquired Professor
Scott. &ldquo;Shall we strike down to the coast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; nodded Ned. &ldquo;Then we can beat
up the coast toward the ranch, keeping our eyes open
for the boys. Surely they didn&rsquo;t go any further
south than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly not,&rdquo; Don put in. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t tell, but
I feel we should go to the shore and see if we can
pick up anything there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They now said goodbye to the sage, who did not
feel inclined to go any further with them. He was
used to solitude and did not care to mix in with
their problems and adventures, and he refused any
pay for his hospitality or information. He once
more expressed his belief that they would be fortunate
in their search and then gravely turned his
horse&rsquo;s head back to his mountains, seemingly no
longer interested in what went on. With feelings
of warmest gratitude for him the party from the
ranch went on their journey toward the coast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>The coast was reached in the afternoon and they
began to head north, watching both land and sea
for any trace of the missing boys. Hunger at last
caused them to halt while Yappi prepared and
cooked the rabbit which he had killed, and the
others enjoyed the meat of the little animal. As soon
as this simple repast was completed they once more
moved on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do if we don&rsquo;t find them on this
trip?&rdquo; asked Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go to San Diego, recruit a good-sized
force and hunt Sackett from one end of Lower
California to the other,&rdquo; replied Ned, grimly. &ldquo;And
we may have to get the proper Mexican officials on
the job, too. You see, it is possible that Sackett
may have carried them off to Mexico, and if that
is the case we&rsquo;ll have a fine time locating them. But
we&rsquo;ll leave no stone unturned to do it, you may be
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime we&rsquo;ll leave Yappi at the
ranch in case any news of them should come there,&rdquo;
the professor suggested.</p>
<p>Yappi was riding ahead and was just topping a
small rise when they saw him slip from the back of
his horse and lie flat on the ground. He motioned
to them to dismount and they did so, wondering.
Cautiously they moved up beside him and looked
over the brow of the small hill into the vale below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>The sight that met their eyes astonished them.
Off to their left was the sea, not now the calm Pacific,
but a tumbling, boiling stretch of water, still showing
the effects of the storm. An eighth of a mile off shore
a schooner lay on its side, the black expanse of the
hull showing above the water, a portion of the keel
rising out of the waves. The ship had evidently run
aground during the storm, for there was a gaping
hole in the bow and the masts were snapped off
short, the rigging strewing the deck and trailing into
water. But it was the sight of several men in the
hollow below which drew their greatest attention.</p>
<p>The men were members of the crew of the
schooner and they were at present gathered around a
small fire. They had been wet and bedraggled and
were gathered close to the fire as though their only
concern was to get warm. Some of the crew had
gathered wood and lay it piled high nearby. No one
was keeping watch and the party on the hill top had
not been seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim and Terry aren&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; whispered Don, in
disappointment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>They were not, and Ned was about to advise that
they pass on, when Yappi seized his arm and pointed
to a spot some half mile down the shore, to the
north of the men. To their astonishment they perceived
another schooner, standing at anchor in a
cove, and a boat was putting out from that schooner
and making for the shore. The second schooner
was in good condition and had apparently not suffered
from the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as though those fellows were after
the men below,&rdquo; the professor said, in a low tone.</p>
<p>They watched the boat from the schooner discharge
its load of men, who immediately took to
the shelter of a friendly hill and made their way
silently toward the party which sat around the fire.
The oncoming men were led by a tall old man with
white hair, who seemed to have full authority, for
the sailors, who were an orderly looking lot in
comparison with the crew below, obeyed his every
gesture. They crept nearer the unsuspecting men
below until they were on a hilltop opposite from the
ranch party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; murmured Ned. &ldquo;I think we are going
to witness a battle!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Scarcely had he spoken than the old captain waved
his hand and his band rushed down on the men
who were seated around the fire. Their coming
was totally unexpected and the crew from the
wrecked schooner sprang to its feet in dismay. The
men from the second schooner fell on them bodily
and a free-for-all fight began, a fight that was short-lived,
for the second crew were superior in number
and moreover, was armed. After a few knock-downs
the wretched crew was overcome and all
neatly tied up by their attackers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say I don&rsquo;t understand this,&rdquo;
said the professor. &ldquo;I wonder which one of the
parties is in the right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Ned. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got
to go down and ask them if anything has been
learned of Sackett or the boys. But I am not sure
but what we are running our heads into some sort
of a trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mestizo had been following the events below
with absorbed interest and had forgotten everything
else. He turned to speak to the others. But
instead of speaking at them he stared back of them,
and then, with a motion like that of a cat, he made
a quick dive for his rifle, which was laying beside
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">THE ESCAPE</span></h2>
<p>It seemed to Jim that he was under tons of water
and that everything around him was a roaring whirl
of confusion. His lungs were filled with water
and close to bursting when he finally gained a breath
of fresh air after expelling the water from his
lungs. He was still on the deck of the <i>Galloway</i>,
crumpled up against the deckhouse and half buried
in the wash which still swept across the deck.</p>
<p>His first act was to stagger weakly to his feet
and look for Terry. He was relieved to see the well
known red-head emerge from behind some lashed-down
canvas on the deck, and a moment later the
boy was staggering toward him, furiously blinking
his eyes. To their surprise they found that the
deck of the schooner was tilted on a decided angle
and that the starboard rail was well under water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>The schooner had run hard aground and had
settled on its side. One or two of the crew had
been swept over the side and lost, the whole thing
having happened so quickly that no aid could be
given them. The rest of the men were picking
themselves up from the deck and looking dazedly
around, uncertain as to the next move. Captain
Ryan shouted orders which could be heard above
the din and the men worked their way over the
sloping deck to the large life boat which was hanging
at the port side.</p>
<p>Terry started to follow them but Jim grasped
his arm, placing his mouth close to his ear. &ldquo;Wait
a minute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let them go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going with them?&rdquo; asked Terry,
astonished.</p>
<p>Jim shook his head. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stay here. I don&rsquo;t
think this ship is going to sink, and we can make
our escape. Let&rsquo;s duck behind the wheelhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry was a bit bewildered but he followed Jim&rsquo;s
lead in crouching out of sight. &ldquo;Do you think it
is safe?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Those fellows are leaving the
schooner, and they should know if it isn&rsquo;t going to
sink.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those fellows are scared to death,&rdquo; Jim said.
&ldquo;They have forgotten about us and the only thing
they have in mind is to get to shore. I don&rsquo;t think
the ship will go under because it is too firmly
grounded. We can give them time to get to the
shore and when the storm lets up we can get ashore
ourselves. Remember, if we don&rsquo;t want to make a
long trip to Mexico, we must get away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right there,&rdquo; murmured Terry. &ldquo;Did
you get hurt any in the crack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a bruise on my shoulder, that&rsquo;s all. Look,
there goes the crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crew had jumped into the life boat and had
pushed it away from the schooner&rsquo;s side. Captain
Ryan gave one sweeping look around the wrecked
ship as the boys hastily ducked from sight, and
satisfied that they had been swept overboard and
drowned, he gave the order to pull for shore. The
men settled to it with a will, and before many
minutes had passed the boys lost sight of them in
the gloom which hung over the sea and blotted out
the shore.</p>
<p>Terry stood up and looked around. &ldquo;Alone at
last, as the song says. Wonder if we are the only
ones on board?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Jim replied, looking rapidly around.
&ldquo;Is there any other boat aboard?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>A thorough search convinced them that there was
no other boat on the wreck. They tried to get
down into the hold to look around, but it was filled
with water. The schooner would have sunk like
a shot except that it had folded up on a rock and
was held there. Jim noted that the rail was going
deeper into the water with the passage of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get off in some manner,&rdquo; he told
his companion. &ldquo;I think the ship is slowly turning
over, at least it is going to settle completely on
its side. But as to how to get off is the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry peered off toward the shore, over the heaving
water. &ldquo;The blow has gone down considerably,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;The shore isn&rsquo;t far off, you can
see it. Do you think you could make it by swimming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could,&rdquo; replied Jim, after considering.
&ldquo;How about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could if I had something to hang onto and
get a breathing spell once in awhile,&rdquo; Terry thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can settle that. We can lash a couple
of spars together and use them for resting stations.
Goodness knows that there are enough spars
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They secured two large spars and roped them
together firmly. Shedding all of their clothing except
those absolutely necessary for use on shore they
were about to leave the ship when Jim was struck
with an idea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can take along all of our clothes by tying
them on the spars,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>They tied all of their clothes to the top of the
spar and threw it into the foaming sea, which had
abated in force considerably during the last twenty
minutes. Realizing that the men would be on shore
directly ahead of them and not wishing to fall into
their clutches they decided to head for a point
further down the shore, and with this plan in mind
they dove off together, landing with a rush in the
stinging salt water. When they bobbed up and
shook the water out of their eyes they saw the spars
a few feet before them. They struck out for the
rude craft and each boy passed one arm over it,
propelling with the other.</p>
<p>In this manner the spars kept progress with them
in their attempt to escape to the shore, and when
they became tired, which was often in the long
struggle, they hung onto the spars and rested. They
knew better than to waste breath in idle talk, so no
word was spoken during the fight for shore. Jim
was a better swimmer than the red-headed boy, but
Terry grimly stuck it out, and after a half hour
battle they landed on the shore, almost exhausted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Terry splashed his way up to the beach, collapsing
in a heap on the wet sand, but Jim, blown as he
was, had presence of mind enough to take the clothing
off of the raft and look around them. The
storm was blowing itself out and the sky growing
lighter, but as there was no sight of the men nearby
Jim soon lay down beside his companion and rested
gratefully. They had drifted a mile or more down
the shore in their swim and felt reasonably safe
from capture.</p>
<p>Jim was the first to sit up and he looked keenly
around. They were in a lonely section of coast
country, uninhabited and infinitely dreary. He
wondered what the next best plan should be, and
asked Terry. Both felt that it would be foolish to
go back toward the ranch directly, and both agreed
that it would be foolish to go south.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means we push inland,&rdquo; Terry nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is all that we can do. And we are
in one fine shape to do that, I must say! No
weapons, no matches, and not a thing to eat! If
we don&rsquo;t fall into somebody&rsquo;s hands we&rsquo;ll starve,&rdquo;
said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look tough from every angle,&rdquo; Terry
agreed. He got up and wrung the water out of
his trousers and shirt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty tired, but I
suppose we ought to get moving, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. At least we should get away from
the coast. Maybe when we get inland we can find
some place to put up for the night, some hollow or
something. After a good night&rsquo;s sleep we should
be able to cover a lot of ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Terry hasn&rsquo;t been bad, but he has to go
to bed without his supper!&rdquo; the red-headed boy
grimaced, as they started inland.</p>
<p>They walked slowly, keeping a sharp lookout, but
met no one in their journey. They meant to make
a long half circle in their return, planning to avoid
the party from the schooner and Sackett&rsquo;s henchmen.
There was also the possibility that they might
run across their own party, who they felt was surely
looking for them. But the present object was to
find some protected shelter and hide away for the
night.</p>
<p>Evening was close upon them when Jim suddenly
pulled Terry down behind a bush. He pointed
to the right and whispered to his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man, over there!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Terry looked, to see a lone traveler encamped in
a small hollow some little distance from them. The
man was seated beside a small fire, busily engaged
in frying something in a small pan. His horse, a
beautiful black animal, was grazing on the short
grass nearby, and the man&rsquo;s rifle stood close at
hand. Terry turned to Jim with a satisfied air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my supper!&rdquo; he announced, pointing to
the pan in the man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that,&rdquo; Jim warned. &ldquo;We
want to be mighty careful who we walk up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you don&rsquo;t think every human being in this
country belongs to Sackett&rsquo;s gang, do you?&rdquo; asked
Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; Jim gave in. &ldquo;Shall we walk
up and announce ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll walk up and reserve a table!&rdquo; grinned
Terry. &ldquo;That pan excites me; let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They advanced toward the man, who did not see
them coming until they were barely twenty yards
from him. Then he looked up and they saw that he
was a Mexican. He gave a slight start and reached
for his gun, but allowed his fingers to slide from
the stock as he continued to look at them. At the
same time the boys recognized him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Alaroze, the overseer of Senorita Mercedes
ranch!&rdquo; cried Jim, and Terry nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Seeing that he was recognized the Mexican broke
into a smile and welcomed them in Spanish. He
was frankly puzzled at their strange and uncouth
appearance, but he did not ask any questions. Jim,
who could speak fair Spanish, told him that they
had taken a trip down the coast in a ship and had
been cast ashore, feeling that it would not be wise
to tell too much. When the Mexican had heard
their story he expressed himself as being deeply
grieved and hastened to offer them food. He had
some beans and bread and seemed to have a plentiful
supply with him, so the boys were not averse
to taking what he offered.</p>
<p>They sat down and gratefully ate what he set
before them. The overseer talked rapidly, smiling,
rebuilding the fire and insisted upon cooking them
more of his provisions. Once when he was out
of earshot Terry spoke out of the corner of his
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a half-bad fellow, this Alaroze. I didn&rsquo;t
think I liked him at the ranch, but he surely is
treating us royally now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly is,&rdquo; agreed Jim, heartily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
see to it that he never regrets it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Finally the Mexican sat down and ate with them
and afterward smoked cigaret after cigaret as he
talked with them. He did not seem to be inquisitive
as to the whereabouts of the others, in fact, Jim
was more curious than the foreman, for presently
he asked him what he was doing so far away from
the Mercedes ranch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am looking for stray cattle,&rdquo; the overseer said.
&ldquo;Many of them have wandered away of late and I
am looking for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was growing dark now and they made a large
fire, before which the boys dried their dripping
clothes. The three companions agreed to head back
for the ranch of the senorita on the following day
and to go from there to the Scott ranch. Jim
and Terry warmly thanked the overseer for his
supper and hospitality, but the Mexican was effusively
modest about it.</p>
<p>Quite early the three of them turned in, the
Mexican lingering for some little time after the
boys. He sat beside the fire, still smoking his inexhaustible
cigarets, looking out into the blackness
of the night. He seemed to have no fear of anyone.
The boys lay under the shelter of some sandy banks,
for the Mexican had but one blanket, and just before
they fell asleep they looked at the lone figure
near the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky thing for us that we fell in with him,&rdquo;
Jim commented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; Terry returned. &ldquo;He certainly
has been fine to us. I&rsquo;m just about sorry I ever
distrusted him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go by looks,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
think he is pushing his search for those stray cattle
very vigorously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know how lazy most of these Mexicans
are,&rdquo; Terry yawned. &ldquo;Probably just taking his
own sweet time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny he should be out looking for them, instead
of the other cowboys,&rdquo; Jim went on. &ldquo;I should
think that he would be needed at the ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is his personality that counts,&rdquo; grinned
Terry. &ldquo;He may attract the cows and bring &rsquo;em
home that way. I don&rsquo;t care how he does it. I&rsquo;m
going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys fell into a deep sleep. The Mexican
sat motionless beside the fire for some time longer.
Once he turned and looked toward the boys, at
the same time smiling at some thought which was
passing through his head. His teeth gleamed for a
second and then his face once more became impassive.
Shortly after that he rolled himself up in
his blanket and fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">TREASURE AND TREACHERY</span></h2>
<p>The boys slept late the next morning and when
they awoke the Mexican was still lying on his
blanket, not sleeping but still not working. Feeling
that they should do something to earn the hospitality
of their new-found friend the two boys
brought wood from the thicket and kindled the fire.
The Mexican gave them some beans and they
speedily made enough for all of them.</p>
<p>After they had eaten they started off in the direction
of Senorita Mercedes&rsquo; ranch, the Mexican
riding slowly and the boys walking beside him.
They had managed to dry out their clothes and put
them on, and although they were a mass of wrinkles
and ridges they did well enough. Their shoes had
shrunk somewhat and walking was not easy, but
they stuck to the task manfully, plodding along
mile after mile without complaint.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Several times during the trip the overseer got
down from his horse and insisted that one of the
boys mount and ride for a few miles, and although
they protested he would not listen to them. So they
rode gratefully, in this way saving themselves from
a good many aches and pains. The Mexican was
not used to walking but he said nothing, trudging
along on one side or the other of the horse cheerfully.</p>
<p>They stopped once for dinner and then pressed on
again. The foreman of the ranch was sure that
they would reach the Mercedes place in two days,
or late on the following day, so they pushed on
eagerly. In the early afternoon they were forced
to take a rest from the heat of the sun, but covered
a few miles before it was time to make camp for
the night.</p>
<p>They were near the coast at the time and their
camp was pitched in the hollow formed by two
small hills. They had looked for a favorable location,
for this one had no wood near it, as the
country was mostly barren, and thickets few and
far between. Some green bushes grew nearby and
they resolved to use these as a final resource, but
before doing so Jim and Terry started out to see
it they could find anything more promising. Terry
went over the top of one hill and Jim over the top
of the other, while the overseer prepared for their
supper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Jim had a small axe which Alaroze had given him
and he walked along the ridge of the small hill
looking carefully around. On the opposite side of
the hill he found a long depression in the soil which
looked as though it might have been the bed of
a stream at one time, perhaps some creek which
had originally flowed from the distant mountains.
He wandered down it aimlessly, convinced that his
quest for wood was not likely to be very successful.
A vast stillness lay over the country and he felt
very much alone. A mile or more to the east of
him he could hear the sound of the ocean.</p>
<p>There was no use in walking down the defile, he
decided, so he started for the slope of the slight
hill which was beside him. As he did so his foot
struck something solid. He bent down to see what
it was and found a small stick of wood protruding
from the sand at his feet. He cleared the sand
away around the stick, to find that it was quite
large and that it ran into the sand for some little
distance. When he had finally drawn it from its
sheath be examined it with curiosity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>It was a piece of mahogany and it showed the
hand of civilization. Although it was now black
with age it had at one time been varnished. It
was a large splinter and he wondered how it ever
got there. Examining it closely he detected signs
which led him to believe that it had been burned at
some time. There was a thin line running across
it that suggested carving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Somebody once
had a fire here and used good wood for it. Perhaps
there is more nearby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this thought in mind he dug his axe deeper
in the sand and began to scoop it out. Before many
minutes had passed he ran across another piece of
wood, but this one he could not get out. It seemed
to have no end and he set to work in earnest to
uncover it. But after he had uncovered about twenty-five
running feet he stopped in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be a house!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Every bit
of it burned, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The top of the long section of wood had been
burned. It was thick wood and he tried to dig
down under it. But after he had dug sand out to
the depth of four feet he stopped and looked puzzled.
It was a straight wooden wall, extending
down into the valley of sand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Jim stopped his work and walked to the top of the
rise, where he slowly looked up and down the pass.
He looked toward the ocean, calculated thoughtfully
and then looked toward the mountains. Then,
looking down toward the long strip of black wood
which he had uncovered he voiced his thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a ship down there, evidently burned to
the water&rsquo;s edge and later covered up by shifting
sand. Now, I wonder&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without finishing his thought he hurried down
to the trench and once more went to work. Digging
some five feet down beside the wall of wood
he came to a flooring of hard planks, just what he
had been looking for. It was the deck of a ship,
and he began feverishly to dip out sand. In this
task he was finally surprised by Terry and the overseer.</p>
<p>Terry had returned to the camp with a few dead
bushes and they had waited around for Jim to
return, but as he did not do so they became alarmed
and set out to find him. Their first glimpse of him
was an odd one. When they topped the rise some
distance back of him they saw him standing in a
deep trench, facing a four foot wall of wood, busily
engaged in scooping sand from the hole and throwing
it as far away as he could. With cries of astonishment
they hurried up to the long trench which he
was making.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; Terry cried, while the Mexican looked
on with bulging eyes. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim started slightly as he straightened up. &ldquo;It is
the remains of a sunken ship,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;See,
this is evidently the rail, a solid wall of wood, and
I&rsquo;m just uncovering the deck. It was burned to
the edge of the water, and later covered up with
sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered!&rdquo; shouted Terry. &ldquo;Do
you think it is the treasure ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt it. As you
can see, I have uncovered about twenty-five feet of
this rail. The deck seems to be good and I&rsquo;m
trying to uncover enough of it to find a hatchway,
so that we can see if it is empty down below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry and the Mexican jumped down beside him.
The Mexican understood enough of English to know
that they thought the ship beneath them might be
a treasure ship, and he set to work with a sincere
will to scoop sand. They could not make much
progress, however, for it was rapidly growing dark,
and at last they were forced to give it up until the
next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the best we can do,&rdquo; Jim decided, peering
about him in the dark. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s chop some of this
wood and then we&rsquo;ll go back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>With his axe he hacked off enough wood to last
them through the night and the three companions
carried it back to their camp, where, amid much talking,
they built the fire and cooked the supper. The
Mexican was told the whole story and he replied
that he knew the legend of the phantom galleon.
The boys were not averse to telling him the story
for they felt that they owed him much and knew
that his future help would mean everything. It
was late that night before they lay down to sleep,
and with the rising of the sun they were up and at
work on the buried wreck.</p>
<p>It took them all the morning to clear the solid
deck of the ancient ship for a space of several feet
and at last they came to a hatchway, covered by
a heavy door which was flush with the deck. There
was a bolt on the door but one blow of the axe
broke it in pieces, and the three united all their
strength to pulling the hatch open. It came upward
at last, releasing a flood of stale and poisonous air
that sent them reeling backward with all possible
speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diable!&rdquo; gasped Alaroze. &ldquo;I think all the fiends
are closed inside!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>When the air had cleared sufficiently they all
peered down the open hatchway, to discover a wide
flight of stairs leading down into the hold of the
ship. There was now no longer any doubt but what
it was the phantom galleon, for it was built on a
magnificent scale. They realized that had it not
been burned the rear of the galleon would never
have been covered up, for the rear of the Spanish
ships were composed of high after-deck houses, but
this ship had been burned and only the deck, which
had been below the water, had remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hold must be full of water and sand,&rdquo; Terry
commented.</p>
<p>Jim swung his feet over the edge of the deck and
gingerly felt the step below. &ldquo;Full of sand, yes, but
not of water. The sand will be wet, though. Now
be careful on these stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stairs were solid and safe, but they did not
go far. Originally the ship had run aground and
filled with water, and in time the sand had filled up
the hold of the galleon. A space of about six feet
only was open, and in this space the foul air had
been held. The three companions found a bed of
moist sand cutting off any further progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is any gold in this ship, it is below the
sand,&rdquo; Alaroze said in Spanish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, senor,&rdquo; nodded Jim. &ldquo;I think we had
better not walk on this sand for fear of falling into
some pit. If we ever sank in this wet stuff, that
would be the end of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It surely would,&rdquo; remarked Terry. &ldquo;What is
this sticking up out of the sand? A piece of
brass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a dull strip of brass, but when Jim scraped
the sand from it they found that it was long and
finally discovered that it was the edge of a brass-bound
chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, somebody&rsquo;s trunk!&rdquo; said Terry, indifferently.</p>
<p>But the eyes of the Mexican were glittering and
Jim himself was excited. &ldquo;More likely the top of a
treasure chest!&rdquo; he retorted, and dealt the chest top
a slashing blow with his axe.</p>
<p>With a shuddering, sucking sound the paper-like
substance tore off, revealing to the three in the hold
a sight which took away their breath. Gold in the
form of coins of all sizes was revealed, gold which
lay and still gleamed in the interior of the trunk.
The Mexican talked furiously to himself in his native
language, and the boys simply stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold, the gold of the treasure ship!&rdquo; gasped
Jim, scarcely able to believe his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Terry picked up some of it and examined it curiously.
&ldquo;It is gold, sure enough,&rdquo; he agreed, dazzled.
&ldquo;Wish we had the professor here to tell us
just what it represents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there is more around,&rdquo; Jim suggested.
He began to dig his axe into the sand, while the
Mexican stood back of him, his eyes gone suddenly
black and calculating. But Jim found that there
was no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably this chest was brought up here, while
the rest of the treasure is still below. At any rate,
even if there is no more, there is enough to make
us all rich.&rdquo; He turned to Alaroze with a smile.
&ldquo;Well, senor, it was lucky for us when we ran across
you, and lucky for you when you agreed to guide
us home. Your share from this will make you a
rich man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, senor,&rdquo; agreed the overseer, breaking
into a smile. &ldquo;I bless the day we met! May the
saints reward you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been rewarded pretty well already!&rdquo;
grinned Jim. &ldquo;Well, what shall we do? We can&rsquo;t
do much of anything until we return home, get the
rest of the party and return here to go to work.
Suppose we take along some of the gold and start
out for the ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>They took several of the largest coins, the hands
of the Mexican trembling as he did so, and made
their way up on deck again. Terry demanded of
Jim if he was going to leave the galleon ruins uncovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Jim. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much chance
of anyone coming this way, and it would take us
hours to cover it up. Let&rsquo;s spend that time on our
homeward journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I hope is that we run across the others in
quick order, then,&rdquo; said Terry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to lose
time while this treasure is lying uncovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the galleon they returned to camp and
prepared to start back for the ranch. The Mexican
went to his horse, picked up his rifle and looked at
it, and then placed it against a tiny mound of sand.
With averted face he picked up the blanket and his
few supplies.</p>
<p>Terry and Jim were conferring earnestly. &ldquo;It
will take a large force of men to dig down into that
wreck,&rdquo; Terry said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let the professor and
Ned decide what is best to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Jim, swinging around. &ldquo;Well, I
guess we&rsquo;re ready to go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Then, both boys stopped suddenly. Standing before
them, with his rifle levelled straight at them,
stood the Mexican overseer. There was a hard light
in his black eyes and his mouth was a straight line,
the lips white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Jim, smiling
slightly, and thinking that there was some joke in
the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is wrong, senor,&rdquo; came the reply. &ldquo;But
since you two know so well where the gold is, I
shall regret the necessity of killing you both so that
it will be all mine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">AN OLD FRIEND JOINS THE PARTY</span></h2>
<p>The party on the hill was surprised at the action
of the mestizo as he fairly pounced upon his rifle.
But before he could even lift it a clear-cut voice
spoke out back of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your hands off of that gun, or I&rsquo;ll drill
a few holes into you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned, to find back of them a little short
man in a blue uniform of a sailor, who had crept up
on them quietly from the rear. He held a rifle in
his hand and turned it unwaveringly toward the
members of the watching group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; demanded the
professor, after a second of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No meaning at all,&rdquo; chuckled the man, whose
uniform proclaimed him a mate on a sailing ship.
&ldquo;You fellows march down the hill until my captain
looks you over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you to tell us to march down the hill?&rdquo;
snapped Ned. &ldquo;This is a free country, in case you
don&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; chuckled the mate. &ldquo;But this here
gun of mine don&rsquo;t know nothing about it! I&rsquo;ve tried
my best to teach the blooming thing, but it&rsquo;s just
naturally ignorant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Don asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on down the hill!&rdquo; commanded the mate, suddenly
changing his tone. &ldquo;The captain will answer
all questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but to obey, so, in silence
the boys and the older man walked down the hill,
leading their mounts. The crowd below saw them
coming and looked on with marked interest. The
captain of the attackers strode to the front. He was
a tall old man with a white beard and snow white
hair, and at sight of him Don caught his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you here, Harvey?&rdquo; the captain
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bunch was lying on their tummies and
looking over the hill at you,&rdquo; answered the mate,
a twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we were, Captain Blow,&rdquo; said Don, boldly.
&ldquo;How are you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Captain Blow, their old friend from Mystery
Island, started at hearing his name, and looked
closely at Don&rsquo;s smiling face. He had been their
staunch friend at the time they made their summer
cruise and captured the marine bandits. Recognition
dawned on him and he joyously seized the boy&rsquo;s
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, by jumping Tunket, if it isn&rsquo;t Don
Mercer!&rdquo; he roared heartily. &ldquo;What in the name of
Goshen are you doing out here, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don explained briefly that he was staying with
the Scotts at their ranch and then looked around at
the sullen captives. &ldquo;What is all this, Captain
Blow?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These fellows are one fine bunch of prison birds
who are soon going in their cage!&rdquo; retorted the captain
vigorously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running a schooner out here, in
the carrying trade now, and this Captain Jake Ryan
run off with two of my men. Last night I chased
them but lost &rsquo;em in the storm. Early this morning
I saw the wreck and sent my mate there ashore to
locate them. When he gave me the signal, from
the hill back of where you were looking, we came
ashore. He saw you fellows and thought you were
part of the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don then introduced the Scotts and told the captain
of their search for Jim and Terry. The captain
was deeply interested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;These fellows are part of Sackett&rsquo;s gang,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Maybe they know something.&rdquo; He turned
to the scowling Ryan. &ldquo;Did you have anything to
do with two boys?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Ryan, promptly.</p>
<p>But one of the men who had been liberated by the
coming of Captain Blow spoke up quickly. &ldquo;Yes
he did, Captain Blow! Those two boys came
aboard yesterday just before the storm, down at the
old tannery. And they are still aboard the wreck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know they weren&rsquo;t swept overboard?&rdquo;
shouted Jake Ryan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how I know, you scoundrel!&rdquo; snapped
the sailor, shaking his fist in Ryan&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;When
you stampeded for the lifeboat I saw those two boys
duck down behind some canvas and I told you to put
back and make &rsquo;em come off in the lifeboat, but you
was so scared you wouldn&rsquo;t go back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; Ryan retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No it isn&rsquo;t. Those boys are still on the ship,&rdquo;
said the sailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they decided to stay on the schooner and
keep out of the hands of these fellows,&rdquo; decided Captain
Blow. &ldquo;Too bad they didn&rsquo;t come right along,
and we would have them now. But we&rsquo;ll probably
find them out there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is once Jim and Terry figured their move
wrong,&rdquo; grinned Don, greatly relieved at the news
concerning his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they thought they were doing the correct
thing,&rdquo; put in the professor. &ldquo;Now, what do
you propose to do with these men, Captain Blow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blow turned to his mate. &ldquo;Harvey, you and the
men march these fellows back to the boats and take
&rsquo;em to the schooner. I&rsquo;m going out to the wreck
with these men and I&rsquo;ll be back to the ship later.
Don&rsquo;t let one of these rats escape, and we&rsquo;ll take
them to prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir!&rdquo; replied Harvey. The crew
hustled the captives away over the top of the hill
and then Captain Blow turned to the party of friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll go out and look that wreck over,&rdquo; he
announced. The boat in which the crew of the
<i>Galloway</i> had reached shore was still lying upon
the sand, and they all climbed in and pushed off, the
old captain, Ned and Don taking the oars. It was
the first time that the mestizo had ever been in a
boat and he sat gingerly in the bow, holding himself
stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you leave Mystery Island, Captain
Blow?&rdquo; asked Don, as they rowed out to the wreck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;Early in the spring,&rdquo; replied the old captain.
&ldquo;When I saw you last I told you that Mystery Island
would soon be a regular summer colony, now that
the old house and bandits are gone, and sure enough,
that is what happened. Got so full of young men
with white pants and slicked down hair and young
ladies with tootin&rsquo; roadsters that my polly and me
didn&rsquo;t have any peace at all. So I came west, got
a nice schooner, and am now running between here
and Mexico, picking up anything I can get, mostly
fruit. I didn&rsquo;t have any trouble, although I had
heard plenty about this Sackett, until a few days ago
when this Ryan ran off with two of my men. Kidnapped
them in some eating house in San Francisco
and I went right after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; nodded Don. &ldquo;So Bella, the parrot, is
still living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yup! She&rsquo;s still sayin&rsquo; &lsquo;Bella is a good girl.&rsquo;
Probably she&rsquo;ll still be saying that after I&rsquo;m dead
and gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had now approached the wreck and the captain
made fast the painter of the lifeboat. Climbing
aboard was somewhat of a task, as the deck sloped
dangerously, but by dint of clinging to every support
available they managed to do so. But a hasty survey
of the deck revealed that the two boys were not
on board.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they are in the hold,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt that,&rdquo; replied Captain Blow. &ldquo;That hold
must be full of water. You see, these fellows crowded
on all canvas to get away from me and they ran in
too close to shore, with the result that they jammed
hard and fast aground. The bottom must be stove
in plenty and full of water, and the only reason they
didn&rsquo;t sink is because they are sort of lying on a
shelf. However, we&rsquo;ll give a look down the companionway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look down into the hold of the wrecked
schooner proved that Captain Blow was right in his
surmises. The hold was filled with water and it was
manifestly impossible for anyone to have gone down
there. Don was worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose they were swept overboard,
do you?&rdquo; he asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the captain promptly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. My
sailor says they ducked down behind something to
keep hidden probably with the idea of escaping all
by themselves. My idea is that they grabbed a spar
or two, swam to shore, and got away that way. I
wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if they was even now
heading up the shore toward your ranch, professor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are right, Captain,&rdquo; replied the professor.
&ldquo;They certainly wouldn&rsquo;t stay here when
there was no necessity for it, and they probably
swam ashore, as you say. I think, therefore, that we
should go ashore and follow up the coast, in the
hope of overtaking them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to overtake them,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;We
are mounted and they aren&rsquo;t. No use in wasting any
more time around here, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Captain Blow answered, slipping down the
deck. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way to the shore the professor told the
captain about the treasure hunt and he was tremendously
interested. Once on shore he spoke about
going back to his boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you the best of luck,&rdquo; he told Don. &ldquo;By
thunder mighty! I wouldn&rsquo;t mind going with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Don, quickly. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
your mate sail with these men to the city and stop
for you on the return trip? I feel sure that the rest
of us would be glad to have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We surely would!&rdquo; said Ned and his father, together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I guess that would do,&rdquo; said the captain
slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sure like to go along. Will you
give me time to go out and tell Harvey what to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>They assented and the captain signalled for a
boat, which took him off to his schooner. He was
gone for about fifteen minutes, and when he came
back he had a blanket and some supplies. He joined
them and the boat put off once again for the
schooner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harvey is in complete charge,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll stop for me at Quito on the way back. I&rsquo;m
ready to go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mestizo surrendered his horse to the captain,
who protested vigorously, but the mestizo was a
far better hand at trotting along than the old salt,
so they arranged to share the horse, and when it was
cooler, to ride it double. Feeling that their best plan
was to push on back to the ranch they started off,
leaving the deserted wreck far behind them.</p>

<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">THE TAR BARREL</span></h2>
<p>Jim and Terry looked helplessly at the Mexican
overseer as he faced them with levelled rifle and the
cool assurance that he would kill them to keep the
treasure from the galleon for himself. They tried
to believe that he was only joking, but from the set
on his face and the glint in his eyes they knew better.
All too often in the history of gold hunting and discovery
had the discoverers paid for it with their
lives, so that someone else could reap the reward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should you wish to kill us, senor?&rdquo; Jim
asked in Spanish. &ldquo;Have not we agreed to see that
you have a large share in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know that you will keep your word to
me?&rdquo; the Mexican answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I like that!&rdquo; cried Jim. &ldquo;We know how to
keep our word, Senor Alaroze!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; returned the overseer, with a slight
shrug. &ldquo;Why should I not have all of it instead of
a small part?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if you feel that way about it,&rdquo; said Jim,
turning pale.</p>
<p>While Jim had been talking Terry had been doing
some rapid thinking. They were standing close to
the man, and the extended muzzle of the rifle was
within easy reach. Any kind of motion toward it
would be sure to be disastrous, and Terry knew it.
There was one thing needed and Terry did it. With
great coolness, a feeling which he was far from possessing,
he looked over the shoulder of the overseer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, carelessly. &ldquo;I guess neither of
us will get the treasure. Here comes Sackett and his
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He used just the right amount of conviction in
his tones and he won. Jim looked away over the
Mexican&rsquo;s shoulder and was fooled as completely as
the overseer. With a muttered imprecation the man
turned his head slightly to see who was back of him.
That motion was his undoing. Quick as a flash
Terry&rsquo;s foot came up in a splendid football kick that
sent the rifle flying upward. Before the astonished
ranchman could move the red-headed boy flung himself
on him and punched him a hard wallop on the
stomach. With a groan the Mexican sank to the
ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, Chucklehead!&rdquo; cried Jim, springing
forward and securing the gun. &ldquo;Now we have
this fellow where we want him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They dragged the crestfallen Mexican to his feet
and tied his hands behind him with a piece of cord
which they had originally tied their clothes to the
spars with. He groaned and moaned and begged
them to show mercy to him. Terry became impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; he ordered, savagely. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t
done that our two bodies would have been lying here
right this minute, and here you are crying your head
off for mercy! You&rsquo;re getting a whole lot better than
you deserve right now, let me tell you. Don&rsquo;t howl
until you get back to the ranch, then we&rsquo;ll give you
something to howl about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still dazed at their terrible peril the boys started
on the journey, placing the cowardly overseer on the
horse and following close behind. When darkness
came down they made camp, fed the captive without
speaking with him, and then made camp for the
night, resolving to take turns at keeping watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let this snake get loose again,&rdquo; warned
Jim. &ldquo;If he ever gets away, good night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the luckiest break we ever had,&rdquo; said
Terry. &ldquo;If he had been standing any further away
I never could have done it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>Jim took the first watch and Terry the second,
during which time the Mexican seemed to sleep
calmly. His hands had been untied, so they covered
him with the rifle and kept unwavering eyes upon
him. In the morning the march was resumed and
late in the afternoon they approached the ranch of
the Senorita Mercedes.</p>
<p>The senorita was the first to approach and she expressed
amazement at the strange sight which they
presented as they walked down into the ranch yard.
Jim related the story to her and she was deeply interested.
Turning to the sullen foreman she upbraided
him furiously in Spanish and turned back
to the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not go away to look for stray cattle,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;None of my cattle have strayed. I do not
know why he left me, but I think he is part of that
wicked Sackett band. I think he was only kind to
you so he could place you in that man&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George, I&rsquo;ll bet that is right!&rdquo; exclaimed Jim,
and Terry nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put him in that small shed,&rdquo; directed the senorita,
pointing to a little building which stood at the edge
of the ranch yard. &ldquo;Then come to the house and
rest and eat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Quite willingly the two boys locked the silent
prisoner in the little shed and returned to the ranch
house. The energetic little senorita had hot water,
soap and towels laid out for them, and they fairly
revelled in the washing process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a kid,&rdquo; grinned Terry, &ldquo;I loved
to have a dirty face, but now I know just what
luxury it is to feel clean again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope I don&rsquo;t break this comb of the senorita&rsquo;s
trying to comb my tangled hair,&rdquo; grunted Jim. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t honestly say that we are any beauties to appear
at the table of the young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they sat down with the youthful and beautiful
owner of the little ranch to eat she said: &ldquo;My
men are at present eating, but as soon as they have
finished I shall send one of them to Ned&rsquo;s ranch for
your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very kind of you, Senorita,&rdquo; murmured
Jim, as he ate ravenously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; laughed the girl, tossing her head.
&ldquo;You have been through such thrilling adventures
of late! Tell me more about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jim knew more Spanish than Terry it fell to
him to relate the experiences of the past few days.
They were lingering over their coffee when an excited
ranchman burst into the room. All three at
the table rose quickly and the man poured something
out in some unknown dialect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ride immediately to the Scott ranch for help!&rdquo;
commanded the senorita, growing pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, senorita, the house is surrounded, I cannot
go,&rdquo; said the man, in Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, is the house surrounded?&rdquo; asked Jim,
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the senorita, rapidly. &ldquo;This man
tells me that Sackett and three men rode down, let
Alaroze out, and are creeping to the house. Fly to
the doors, quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying was necessary. Terry and Jim hurled the
main door of the ranch house shut just in time to
keep Sackett and Abel from rushing it. Rapidly,
under the direction of the girl, they closed all windows
and drew the blinds. Then she gave them each
a rifle and took one herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must watch diligently,&rdquo; she said, her eyes
shining. &ldquo;They will try to burst in and we must
keep them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shot rang out and a bullet crashed through the
front door. Feeling that they would be attacked
from more than one side they separated, Jim going
to the front of the house and Terry and the senorita
keeping watch on the sides. Several shots were
fired, all of which did no harm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>It was now very dark and their peril was increased.
A concerted rush might blast their hopes and Jim in
particular was worried. It would be bad enough to
have to surrender to Sackett&rsquo;s gang, but it would be
far worse to have the dainty senorita fall into their
hands. He set his teeth and determined that it
should not happen. There was complete silence outside,
a silence that was not reassuring.</p>
<p>Jim went to the girl where she was crouching
beside a window, peering out into the darkness of
the yard. He knelt down beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that one of your men could have
slipped away to Ned&rsquo;s ranch?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say no, senor. My man tells me
that they were all penned up in their bunkhouse.
There is no way we can let our friends know of our
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. They couldn&rsquo;t see a light from the top
of the ranch, could they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the hills are too high. We must fight these
men off until morning and then see what we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could only attract Ned&rsquo;s attention someway,&rdquo;
said Jim. &ldquo;Watch out, senorita!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fairly dragged her away from the window as
a shot tore in through the glass and the blinds. She
shook him off, but kept away from the exposed part.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing&mdash;Ah, the tar barrel!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is there a tar barrel?&rdquo; asked Jim, quickly,
as Terry fired his rifle out of another window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see that hill?&rdquo; asked the senorita, pointing
to a low mound back of the ranch. &ldquo;On top of that
hill is a barrel which is half full of tar. I have been
using it to repair my roofs, and it is half full. If
that could only be lighted they would see it at Ned&rsquo;s
ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; cried Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll light that tar barrel
myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor, you will be killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe!&rdquo; said Jim, grimly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll start that
bonfire, anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He related his plan to Terry, who warmly assented,
and a little later Jim worked his way to a
side of the house where there was no shooting.
Senorita Mercedes wanted to send her ranchman out
on the perilous venture but Jim had opposed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It means everything to
have it succeed, and the man might get scared or
bungle it in some way. Let me do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>He opened a low window on the quiet side of the
house, while Terry stood in the shadows, prepared
to shoot down anyone who should loom up. Jim
dropped out of the window and lay flat alongside of
the house, and after a moment he raised his head.
The attacking party was in the front and the rear
of the house and he had not been seen. Terry closed
the window and watched Jim slide forward along
the ground toward the distant barn.</p>
<p>Fortunately the night was dark and Jim had a
good opportunity. Using extreme care he reached
the barn and then looked toward the hill where the
tar barrel stood. The senorita had stood it on the
hill because she was afraid of fire and thought it
best to keep it away from the ranch building. Bending
low Jim ran quickly toward the black barrel and
reached it in safety.</p>
<p>Near the house he could see three shadows and he
knew that they were Sackett&rsquo;s men. They had not
dreamed that anyone would be foolhardy enough to
leave the building and so they waited for a favorable
opportunity to rush the doors and break in. They
had no intention of doing so as long as those three
guns were flashing out viciously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>There were still three flashes from the house and
Jim readily saw what had happened. Terry or the
senorita had given the ranchman who had brought
the news of the attack a gun and he was firing.
Probably the attacking party thought Jim was still
in the house. Lying flat on the ground Jim took a
long piece of paper from his pocket and a box of
matches. He placed the papers in the soft tar and
lighted it.</p>
<p>The tar caught fire quickly, so quickly that Jim
was bathed for a second in its light. He had made
no plans for a retreat, and as the tar barrel burst
into flames he was clearly revealed.</p>
<p>A shout arose from the men who were attacking
the house and they sprang recklessly from cover and
dashed toward him. This piece of carelessness cost
them dearly, for the senorita and Terry each
brought one man down with accurate shots in the
legs. At the same time Jim sprinted for the corner
of the barn and crouched there, his rifle held in readiness
to bring down anyone who should attempt to
put out the blazing beacon.</p>
<p>Higher and higher blazed the barrel with its cargo
of tar, sending its light for several miles over the
surrounding countryside. The outlaws had now
rushed back to cover, to consider what move to make
next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surely hope the others are at Ned&rsquo;s and that
they see that light,&rdquo; thought Jim fervently, as he
waited in his position back of the barn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">THE CAIRN</span></h2>
<p>Professor Scott, the captain, Don and Ned
were all sitting around a fire in the living room
discussing the next move to be made. To their intense
disappointment they had not found the missing
boys upon their return to the ranch, nor had
they come across a single trace on their homeward
journey. They had just decided that a more vigorous
hunt must be started in the morning when Yappi
hastily entered the living room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a large fire at the ranch of Senorita
Mercedes, senor,&rdquo; he informed Ned.</p>
<p>The young man jumped to his feet in dismay.
&ldquo;Oh, I hope those fellows haven&rsquo;t set her ranch on
fire!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what is up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>The entire party ran to the back door and looked
across the plains in the direction of the Mercedes
ranch. Just as the mestizo had said, the sky in that
direction was red and they could see the flames
against the sky. But it was several feet south of
the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the house,&rdquo; decided Ned. &ldquo;Perhaps they
are just burning some old rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should she select a hilltop to burn rubbish
on?&rdquo; asked the professor, sensibly. &ldquo;Does she
usually burn things at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Ned. &ldquo;There must surely be
something wrong. Yappi, the horses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mestizo sprang around the house and went
to the barn, from which he soon led mounts for
all of them. He was instructed to stay at the ranch
with the cook, in case the boys should return, and
then the others threw themselves on the animals and
started off. Ned and Don rode well in front, their
anxiety making them impatient, while the professor
and the captain, who were not riders of note, lagged
somewhat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>It was not a long journey to the ranch of the
senorita, but to the boys it seemed long, and when
at last they ascended the last hill they drew a breath
of relief. They were now near enough to see that
the blazing beacon was a tar barrel, and the circumstances
became more puzzling than ever. But
before they had much time to wonder about it they
had topped the rise and were looking down on the
scene below.</p>
<p>The light from the blazing barrel showed them
a curious scene. The outlaws had realized that they
must make one last desperate assault, and at the
present moment they were making it. Four men
were close to the front door, flat in the yard, a log
rolled before them as a shield, over which they
were firing at the door, splintering the wood badly.
They were rolling the log before them as they advanced,
and hoped in this manner to get close enough
to the door to make a determined rush. From the
interior of the house came occasional flashes of fire
from three rifles and from the corner of the barn
came another.</p>
<p>While the relief party was taking this in the professor
and the captain joined them. The attacking
party had not yet become aware of their presence,
and seeing that the moment was favorable Ned and
Don charged down the hill, the older men following.
A single shot, fired by Ned, told Sackett and company
that help had arrived, and without even stopping
to offer resistance they fled in every direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>The captain instantly discharged his gun at one
of the fleeing men and he went down in a heap.
The professor shot Abel in the shoulder and Ned
and Don pounced on the same man, springing from
their horses upon the man. The fourth man, who
was Sackett, ran to the thicket, made a single bound
into his saddle, and thundered away, passing close
to Jim in his corner of the barn, who fired at him
but missed in the excitement.</p>
<p>Jim looked for an instant after the fleeing outlaw
and then dashed around the barn and entered it.
The horses stood there, moving restlessly, and he
selected a fine looking steed and hastily saddled
it. Leading it from the barn he mounted and started
off with all speed after Sackett.</p>
<p>The slim edge of a moon was rising above the
horizon and by its somewhat sickly light Jim was
able to follow the course of the bay pirate. The man
was making straight for the mountain and felt confident
that he would make it, but he was soon undeceived.
The horse which Jim had selected from
the stables of the senorita was a high strung, fiery
animal, and he was eager to run. Jim needed no
spur to keep him at top speed, and the lead which
the bandit had held was steadily cut down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Seeing that he could not make the mountains before
the pursuing boy was well within gunshot the
outlaw made for a patch of trees that stood nearby.
They were a little more than a mile before him,
and consisted of a fairly dense tangle of low bushes
and trees. His idea was probably to make a last
stand there, Jim decided, and the race settled down
grimly in that direction.</p>
<p>Once Sackett turned and fired at Jim, but the shot
went wide of the mark, for the ground was uneven
and the distance too great for accuracy. From
that time on he gave his attention to the task of
escaping, bending low over the neck of his steed
and urging it on. The patch of trees was now very
near and Sackett well in the lead.</p>
<p>The outlaw drove his horse into the shelter of the
little refuge at headlong speed and vanished from
Jim&rsquo;s sight. Jim pulled the steed to a halt and
paused uncertainly. Sackett was in the thicket and
armed, and he knew better than to recklessly dash
on. If his theory was right the pirate was waiting
for him to do that very thing, and it would be the
worst move he could make. So he sat quietly in
the saddle, wondering what his next move should
be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>It was impossible for Sackett to escape to the
mountains without being seen for Jim could see all
around the thicket, and if the man tried to slip from
the other side and continue his flight Jim would
surely spot him. And yet, his object in running into
the brush also puzzled Jim. What could he gain by
that? In a few minutes the others would come up
and they would be able to charge him and take him
prisoner. It seemed to Jim that there was some
deep scheme in the head of the outlaw, and so he
watched with all his senses alert, keeping well out
of gunshot.</p>
<p>In this position Don and Ned found him when
they galloped up a half hour later. Don fairly
threw himself on his brother in his joy and Ned
was equally enthusiastic. Jim was in rags but was
a welcome sight to Don.</p>
<p>Jim explained the position of the outlaw in the
thicket and they were undecided. No sound had
come from the thicket all the time that Jim had
been stationed there, and no one had left the place.
Ned decided that they had better spread out and
rush the cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we rush the woods on three sides we&rsquo;ll have
him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t shoot at all three of us
at once, and we can fairly hurl ourselves into the
place. By coming up on three different points
we can prevent him from running out of one side
of the thicket while we charge in another.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must rush the thicket in a zigzag course,&rdquo;
Don put in. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re likely to be shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agreeing on a gunshot for signal purposes the
three boys took up positions on three sides of the
silent thicket and looked to their rifles. Each one
could see the other and at last Ned discharged his
gun. At top speed they bore down on the thicket,
driving the horses in an irregular line.</p>
<p>To their astonishment there was no shot or sound
from the thicket and they entered it together, to
find it empty of life except for Sackett&rsquo;s horse,
which was quietly grazing close to the edge of the
brush. The patch inclosed by trees was about
twenty-five feet in diameter and was nothing more
than a mere cluster of trees and bushes. The only
thing to be seen, beside the horse, was a huge pile
of stones. They jumped from the horses and looked
at each other in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, where in the world did that man go?&rdquo; demanded
Ned, holding his rifle in instant readiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can search me!&rdquo; answered Don, in bewilderment.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not in the trees, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned looked quickly up and then shook his head.
&ldquo;No, there isn&rsquo;t room enough in these trees for
anyone to hide themselves. He must be in the place,
because he certainly didn&rsquo;t walk out while we were
there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t get away before you came, either,&rdquo;
Jim said. &ldquo;I kept an eagle eye on the place, and he
couldn&rsquo;t have made it without my seeing him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Ned, walking to the horse
and examining it. &ldquo;Just vanished into thin air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don was looking at the heap of stones. It was a
high cairn, composed of stones which had been
heaped there generations ago for some unknown
reason, and moss had grown over the mound. Stones
of a larger size made up the bottom and smaller
stones lay above these. Near the base of it he
found a straight slab with some Spanish lettering
cut upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is written on this stone?&rdquo; he asked Ned.
The young engineer bent over the stone, lighted a
match and read the inscription.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it all out,&rdquo; he replied, as the match
expired in his hand. &ldquo;But it seems to be the burial
place of someone of importance. They had a custom
once of taking a distinguished man and piling
a cairn of stones over his grave. Sometimes the
custom was for anyone who came past to add a
stone to the pile and in that way it grew larger.
This is one of those piles, and someone is buried
down at the bottom of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;All of which doesn&rsquo;t bring us any nearer Mr.
Sackett,&rdquo; murmured Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give anything to
know where that gentleman went to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just seems silly!&rdquo; said Ned, impatiently. &ldquo;You
chase him in here and he simply disappears. That
isn&rsquo;t logical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; cried Don, who had been moving
around the pile of stones, and who was now on the
other side. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t all of these stones be covered
with moss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Ned replied. &ldquo;Why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they aren&rsquo;t covered with moss on this
side. The stones here are different than the others,
and seem to be looser. Come here and give me a
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other two boys hastened to Don&rsquo;s side and
found that he was right. The stones to which he
pointed had a brighter look than the others, and
where the chinks and crevices of the other rocks had
long since been stopped up by moss, these rocks
were singularly free. Moreover, they were not well
placed, and the boys were struck by the same idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned, as he began to tear
away the upper stones. &ldquo;I think I see a thing or
two! Help me with these stones.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>The other two went to work with a will and soon
the stones were pulled out and tossed to one side.
To their intense satisfaction a large opening was
revealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as we thought, the opening of a tunnel!&rdquo;
exclaimed Don.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">THE DEN</span></h2>
<p>No sooner were the words out of Don&rsquo;s mouth
than a burst of flame came from the interior of the
cairn and a shot whistled uncomfortably close to
their heads. They made all haste to retreat, Ned
dragging Jim aside somewhat roughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in there, all right,&rdquo; said Jim, grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there must be a regular hiding place in
there,&rdquo; responded Ned. &ldquo;The question is: how are
we going to get him out? We certainly can&rsquo;t rush
him in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can starve him out,&rdquo; suggested Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will take too long,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;However,
if there isn&rsquo;t anything else to do, we&rsquo;ll do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have another plan,&rdquo; put in Jim. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll smoke
him out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke him out!&rdquo; echoed Don and Ned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, why not? I doubt if there is any other
outlet to that cairn, except maybe some small air-hole,
so we can easily smoke him out. Let&rsquo;s gather
some of this green wood and set it afire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keeping a vigilant lookout toward the mouth of
the uncovered tunnel so as to guard against a sudden
dash or shot the three boys gathered some
fairly green wood, with which they mixed some
dry dead wood, and after piling it near the mouth
of the tunnel, pushed it into place with the butts of
their guns. They knew that the tunnel was straight
and not wide enough to allow the penned outlaw to
fire on them unless they stood directly before the
opening, so they took excellent care to keep out of
range. When the wood was piled Ned leaned cautiously
forward and lighted the pile.</p>
<p>The dry wood caught fire and blazed up, touching
the green wood and causing it to smoke. The boys
stood with guns in readiness to fire a shot into the
entrance of the cave if the bandit tried to make
a thrust at the fire with a view to scattering it. The
flames mounted higher, causing a heavy pall of
smoke from the green wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off your hats and fan it down the opening,&rdquo;
said Ned, suiting the words by the action.
All three of the boys fanned the smoke vigorously,
causing it to go into the tunnel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>They did not have long to wait for results. After
a few moments they heard a violent coughing and
then at last Sackett staggered out into the opening,
still coughing and wiping his streaming eyes. Before
he could use the gun which he held in his hands they
were upon him and had disarmed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Squint Sackett,&rdquo; said Ned, grimly, as they
bound his hands with a piece of rope which was on
his own horse. &ldquo;We have you at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bandit replied by a fit of coughing that made
him red in the face. Seeing that he was quite safe
Don scattered the fire and stamped it out. The quest
was now over and the bay pirate securely bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kids&rsquo;ll pay for this!&rdquo; the man said, hoarsely.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t prove anything against me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; said Don cheerfully. &ldquo;Just stealing,
breaking into a ranch, kidnapping, and a few
other trifles. I guess we can put you where you
belong this time. It was an unlucky day for you
when you decided to attack Professor Scott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we take a look through this cairn and
see what it looks like before we go?&rdquo; suggested
Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Ned. &ldquo;But first we&rsquo;ll tie
this slippery gentleman up. He mustn&rsquo;t be allowed
to get away again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Sackett was tied to a convenient tree and then the
boys made a torch of a dry stick of wood. With
this in hand Ned took the lead and they entered
the mouth of the tunnel, bending low to keep from
scraping their heads on the roof of the passage. They
went down on a slight slope for a distance of about
four feet and then came to a single cave-like room
hollowed out under the rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the whole business now,&rdquo; remarked Ned,
as they peered about the little cave. &ldquo;This place was
evidently some pirate&rsquo;s den years ago, and in some
way Sackett learned of it. You can see that the
place was built for no other purpose, and the slab
outside is a plain blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned was right in what he said. Some forgotten
pirate had purposely built the cairn retreat for a
refuge in time of storm, when the law was hunting
him along the coast. The room was large
enough to contain a blanket and a low table that
had evidently been constructed in the place. Overhead
there was a concealed opening between the
rocks, so that air could get into the place and the
inmates could breathe. Once inside it was an easy
matter to place the rocks before the opening in
such a way that no one except a careful observer
would ever discover it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pretty clever hiding place,&rdquo; remarked
Don. &ldquo;Anyone would have one chance in a hundred
of finding it. I only stumbled across it because I
was curious about the whole mound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It pretty nearly stood Sackett in mighty good
stead,&rdquo; Jim said.</p>
<p>They left the cairn and went back to the thicket,
to find the outlaw tugging frantically at his bonds,
but when he saw them he sullenly ceased and became
quiet. They untied him from the tree, leaving
his hands tied, however, and helped him mount
his horse. Then they left the thicket and started
back for the ranch of the senorita.</p>
<p>Three miles from the ranch they were joined by
the professor, the captain and Terry, who had become
anxious because of their long absence and who
had mounted and set out to find them. The meeting
between the reunited friends was warm and they
were glad to see that the author of all their troubles
was taken at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sackett,&rdquo; said the professor, with a twinkle
in his eyes. &ldquo;It is certainly time that we took
you. You had your inning at taking most of us
and now it is our turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t keep me long,&rdquo; snarled the man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; struck in Captain Blow. &ldquo;But
the big house with the bars will hold on to you
for a good long time, my bucko!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded the bay pirate. &ldquo;I
never did anything to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but your friend Captain Ryan took a couple
of my sailors with him when he sailed on his last
voyage. He&rsquo;s taking another sail right now, down
to San Francisco to the jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tryin&rsquo; to be funny, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; retorted the
river pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of your gang is in custody, Sackett,&rdquo; said
Professor Scott, quietly.</p>
<p>They went back to the ranch, to find the senorita
taking care of four wounded men, all of whom had
slight wounds in the legs or shoulders. The overseer
was one of them and he pleaded for mercy
with the boys. Jim and Terry were undecided but
Captain Blow and the professor were not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t let these fellows go, any of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the
old captain. &ldquo;He would have left you two boys&rsquo;
bodies out there in the desert without thinking about
it, according to Terry&rsquo;s story, so you can&rsquo;t let him
go. Maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t ever turn up to harm you
again, but he&rsquo;s a potential murderer and he&rsquo;s better
off behind bars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>It was now late at night and the whole party
accepted the invitation to remain at the ranch until
morning, at which time they were to take the
prisoners to Quito and see that they were taken
from there to San Francisco. The night passed
without incident and in the morning the whole party,
with the wounded men in a wagon which belonged
to the senorita, started for the sea coast.</p>
<p>The journey to Quito was a long one and all of
them did not make it. The professor dropped off
at the Scott ranch and the others kept on with
the cargo of dangerous rascals. In due time they
reached the town, made out the proper papers, and
then waited two days for a government boat to
come and take the prisoners away. When this
was done they went back to the Scott ranch.</p>
<p>Subsequently Sackett, who was wanted for many
types of crime, was placed behind the bars for the
rest of his life and his crew of men each received
all that was coming to them from their lives
of dishonesty. The river pirates and bay pirate
gang, of which Ryan and his crew formed the main
branch, was broken up once and for all, and it was
a good many years before any of them ever became
free again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>Captain Blow left a message at Quito for his
mate and then joined the party that was going
home. He had been invited to go with them on
their gold hunt and was eager to do so. But this
time all stories had been told and the boys in particular
were impatient to go and dig for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now we&rsquo;ll go have a look at that Spanish
gold,&rdquo; said the captain, as they started on the return
trip. &ldquo;And I want to have a look at that ship
moored in the sand for so long! They say some
of those old-timers were pretty good sailors, but I
don&rsquo;t think much of a skipper who runs his windjammer
under the ground!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">THE DRAGON&rsquo;S LAST STROKE</span></h2>
<p>The sun had barely raised above the horizon
on the following day before the ranch echoed to the
preparations for the treasure hunt. The boys had
slept poorly, looking forward eagerly to the time
when they should be in close contact with the long
buried ship in the desert sands. With hurry and
bustle and good-natured shouts they prepared to set
out.</p>
<p>Now that their minds had been relieved of all
anxiety concerning Sackett and his gang their spirits
soared as only those of the young adventurous can.
They had spent a jolly evening around the fireplace
on the previous day, talking, planning and laughing
over some of Captain Blow&rsquo;s humorous stories.
It was late before they sought their beds, and the
professor had been compelled to curb some of their
animal vigor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Jim had stood at the foot of his bed, surrounded
by Ned, Don and Terry. Captain Blow and Professor
Scott were preparing for bed in another room
at the time. There had been some pillow throwing
and now Jim was acting a part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the way Terry kicked the gun out of the
overseer&rsquo;s hand,&rdquo; he said. He was in his pajamas
at the time and the other boys were also ready for
bed. Jim loosed a vigorous kick in front of him,
but his enthusiasm proved his undoing. The force
caused him to lose his balance, and amidst the shouts
of delight of his companions he thumped to the
floor, knocking the wind out of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was some kick!&rdquo; exclaimed Don, laughing.
&ldquo;No wonder the poor overseer lost his gun!
If the kick had that much force I bet the gun sailed
clear into the ocean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I protest,&rdquo; put in Terry, solemnly. &ldquo;I never
cut such a wild figure as that! Your imagination
is running away with you, Jimmie, my boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody else had better start running away!&rdquo;
puffed Jim, in huge disgust. &ldquo;Just wait until I get
up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>Once up he bore down on the grinning Terry and
bowled him onto the bed. Don reached for his
foot, but received a hearty thrust in the stomach
from the foot, which Jim declared he had tickled.
Don then jumped on the wiggling chums and Ned
stood laughing. But in a minute he too was drawn
into hostilities. He attempted to pile pillows on
the warring factions, who promptly turned upon
him, and the four young men were soon engaged
in a frantic tussle that overturned one bed and
mussed them up royally.</p>
<p>Such was the scene that greeted the eyes of Captain
Blow and Professor Scott as they hastily entered
the room. The professor opened his mouth
to protest, but the captain, his gray eyes snapping
with mischief, whispered something to him. The
professor smiled and nodded and they ran forward,
the professor seizing the ankles of Terry, who happened
to be on top of the pile, while Blow grasped
his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heave aloft!&rdquo; bellowed the captain, and in concert
they heaved.</p>
<p>To his astonishment Terry felt himself lifted
bodily from the struggling mass and tossed through
the air, to land with a bounce on the bed. Ned Scott
followed and Jim followed him. Don, seeing what
was in the wind, made a frantic scramble to get
under the bed, but to the delight of the watching
boys he was switched from under by the active
captain and treated to a ride through the air. When
he had finally landed with a thud on the bed the
two older men promptly sat on him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the professor, with mock severity.
&ldquo;What is the meaning of all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim was illustrating something,&rdquo; replied Terry,
gravely. &ldquo;And we helped him out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jumping tinder!&rdquo; cried the captain. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what in time you could have been illustrating!
Showing your affection for each other, likely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ever it was,&rdquo; said the professor. &ldquo;I suggest
that you stop it. We want to make an early
start in the morning and you can save some of that
energy for digging sand. From the noise we heard
we thought that Sackett had returned and was trying
to carry one or all of you off. Who upset the
bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us,&rdquo; said Don, truthfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it. Well, to bed now, and calm
down a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Now, on the morning of the hunt, the boys impatiently
ate their breakfast and placed blankets and
provisions on the horses. There was no telling how
long they would linger around the sunken galleon,
and they wanted to be sure that it would not be
necessary to cut the visit short because of a lack of
provisions. It had been decided to take the mestizo
along with them and leave only the cook at home.
When all arrangements had been made they started
briskly off.</p>
<p>The day was bright and somewhat cool and they
made rapid progress, the boys in their eagerness
keeping always ahead of their elders. The older
men wisely held them in check, realizing that there
was a long journey in front of them and not wishing
to run the risk of tiring out before they got
there. They halted once for a meal and then pushed
on, not stopping for a nap in the afternoon, since it
was not hot enough to do so, and just as evening
drew on they topped a small hill and looked down
on the valley in which Jim and Terry had so nearly
lost their life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the wreck!&rdquo; shouted Jim, pointing to
the corner of the galleon which they had uncovered.
&ldquo;Looks as though no one had been near it, all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one had apparently been near the place, for
there were no traces of footmarks in the sand other
than those left by the two boys and the treacherous
overseer. They rode down the incline and picketed
the horses, hastening at once to the few feet of deck
uncovered. The professor gazed at the uncovered
rail in rapture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;By George, this is wonderful!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
his face glowing with the enthusiasm of the scholar.
&ldquo;Just think, after reading a story like that, to run
across the very ship on which it happened! I hope
we can uncover the whole ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; asked Don. &ldquo;Where was that piece of
wreckage found, the piece that first gave the idea of
a sunken galleon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About three miles north of here,&rdquo; replied the
engineer. &ldquo;I guess I see what you are getting at.
You think that the piece was washed out of the creek
that used to be here, and was found, after it drifted
down shore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Don. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surely do,&rdquo; assented Ned, stepping down onto
the deck of the buried galleon. &ldquo;Is this the hatchway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry lifted the hatch, which they had replaced
when they had left the galleon with the Mexican.
&ldquo;Yes, and here is the flight of stairs. Did anyone
bring a flashlight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have one,&rdquo; said the professor, producing it
from his saddle bag. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be very careful about
going down those stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>It was now dark and the flashlight was needed.
The professor flashed the beam of light down the
stairs and went first, treading with infinite care,
but the steps were apparently solid. The others,
with the exception of the mestizo, who would not
trust himself in a place which looked so much like
a trap, followed the savant down into the hold of the
ancient ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the treasure chest,&rdquo; said Jim, and the
professor swung the beam of light on the mouldering
chest. Don lifted the lid and the gold was
revealed.</p>
<p>They fingered it and found that it consisted of
coins of various degrees. The professor did not
recognize any of them except some pieces of eight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry I didn&rsquo;t study up on ancient coins,&rdquo; murmured
the teacher. &ldquo;However, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that
there is quite a fortune here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt there is a substantial treasure further
down in the sand,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the professor agreed. &ldquo;Cups and plate
silver and perhaps other things. The sailors didn&rsquo;t
carry anything away with them, expecting to return
and gather it all on some other occasion, I
presume.&rdquo; He turned his light from side to side.
&ldquo;The hold here was filled with water, and all above
deck must have been burned. We won&rsquo;t find much
of anything until we get down under the sand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>After some more looking around they went outside
and made camp close to the wreck, the boys
again hacking firewood from the remains of the
galleon. They ate supper and then sat around the
fire discussing plans and waiting for the morrow
and daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is going to be quite a job digging into that
sand,&rdquo; observed the captain. &ldquo;In the first place, it&rsquo;s
mighty wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the professor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much afraid
it is too much of a job for us to attempt. It will
take a whole crew to dig down into those ruins,
and a regular excavating gang will be the ones to
do it. However, we can look around and see what
we can pick up ourselves, and then later see to it
that the right sort of a company goes to work on the
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make a legal claim to it, won&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<p>Ned nodded. &ldquo;That will have to be our first
job. If we don&rsquo;t anybody who comes along will
be able to take it right out of our hands. It is
much the same as discovering a gold mine, only in
this case the gold is already refined and cast for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait until morning!&rdquo; said the impatient
Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you said that,&rdquo; the professor spoke
seriously. &ldquo;I want you boys to promise me that you
won&rsquo;t go on the wreck at any time during the night
or in the morning before we are all awake and ready
to tackle it. We have had quite a bit of trouble so
far and we want to avoid any more, certainly any
that may turn out to be more serious than any we
have had. I don&rsquo;t believe that there are any ghosts
or goblins on the thing that will hurt you, but we
had better not do anything that we&rsquo;ll regret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I for one won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Terry promised. &ldquo;I remember
what that dragon says in the old manuscript!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others promised, and after some further talk
they all went to sleep and remained asleep until
daylight. After a hasty breakfast they went to the
wreck once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine day we have for our treasure hunting
party,&rdquo; remarked Don, as they went down the hatchway.</p>
<p>It was indeed a fine day, with a clear blue sky and
a bright sun. Once down in the hold, however, all
light and warmth was shut out, except for a single
shaft that came in from the open hatchway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the professor, who was the leader.
&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t going to be able to do much with this
proposition, but I suggest that we at least dig out
this room. It wouldn&rsquo;t be of any use to dig down
into the main hold of the galleon, for it would
take us months and it would be dangerous work.
Before anything like that is done all sand would
have to be cleared away from the sides of the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room in which they stood, and which held
the chest of gold, was about fourteen feet square.
With small trench shovels brought from the ranch
they went to work on the moist sand, digging it
out and by a system of relays throwing it out on
the deck. Don stood on a wide step where the sand
was deposited by Ned, the professor and Jim, and
shovelled it up to the hatch, where Terry and Blow
threw it to one side. They worked on with a will,
and although it soon became hard work no one
complained.</p>
<p>It was soon found that the chest of gold had
been upon a table at the time of the sinking of the
galleon, for they had scarcely begun their work before
they struck the top of the table. It was soon
uncovered and proved to be a massive affair of black
wood. It was about four feet high, and when they
had cleared away the sand down to the bottom they
found solid flooring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>From time to time they changed positions so as
to give each one a chance to work inside the buried
galleon and also to get a chance at the sunlight.
The person who relayed the sand on the stairs had
the hardest job, as he was compelled to stoop down,
scoop the sand, straighten up and throw it out of
the hatch. Don was not sorry to give up his post
and get out on the deck, and later on to get down
into the old hold.</p>
<p>When Don got downstairs the room had been
almost completely excavated and some more treasure
had been found. Several bars of solid silver
had been uncovered in one corner and even the
walls held relics, in the shape of several old muskets
and knives, along with a rusted sword. There were
two heavy chairs in the room also, which were both
overturned, probably by the force of the shock when
the galleon ran aground.</p>
<p>They stopped at dinner time to eat, all of them
being profoundly grateful for the respite. The room
in which they had been working was now almost
empty and they decided to do a little more work
and then take the gold and as much silver as they
could carry and go back to the ranch, there to put
in motion the necessary machinery to make the
treasure theirs. Accordingly, as soon as the noon
meal was finished, they went back to work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better not do much more excavating,&rdquo; warned
Captain Blow. &ldquo;That pile of wet sand on the deck
is getting pretty heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They finished excavating that room, finding
nothing more of importance and then held a parley.
There was a door in one side of the room and they
were in doubt as to whether to open it. The professor
feared that something might happen if they
did, but the others disagreed with him, so the door
was finally chopped open.</p>
<p>It came out of its frame with a rush, disclosing
nothing but a blank wall of sand. Some portion of
the deck, as yet under sand, had evidently been
ripped off or had burned off, and in that manner
the ship had filled completely, much as a paper boat
that a child buries in the sand. They picked at
the wall of sand before them, but it was solid and
they gave it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess this will be as much as we&rsquo;ll want to
do,&rdquo; the professor announced. &ldquo;The rest of the job
is for a regular crew of excavators, and moreover,
must be undertaken scientifically. We&rsquo;ll be satisfied
to go back with what we have and lay claim to the
rest of it in the right way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you thinking of starting tonight?&rdquo; asked
Terry, looking at his watch. &ldquo;It is five o&rsquo;clock
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that late?&rdquo; cried Captain Blow. &ldquo;By
thunder mighty! this day zipped right by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is that late,&rdquo; retorted the professor, consulting
his own watch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been so busy and
interested that we haven&rsquo;t kept track of the time.
No, we won&rsquo;t start back tonight. We&rsquo;ll stay in camp
and start early in the morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, suppose we get back,&rdquo; suggested the
captain. &ldquo;The bottom of my stomach is sunk lower
than this fishing smack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went up the stairs, Ned and Don stopping
to examine one of the musty guns that was on the
wall. The others stepped off of the deck and onto
the sand, and seeing that the two boys were not
with them, the professor called out: &ldquo;Come on,
boys, back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo; Don replied, as he started up
the stairs, with Ned a step or two back of him.
Don had just thrust his head out of the hatchway
when there came a warning shout from Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;The sand is sliding!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>The wet sand which they had piled up during the
day suddenly slid down the hill with gathering force.
Don sprang forward quickly, but was too late. The
sand hit the deck of the galleon, there was a dull
report and a sucking sensation, and then the whole
room which they had excavated caved in. The deck,
rotting and weakened, gave way under the descending
weight of the wet and dry sand, and went
through with a roar. Don and Ned disappeared from
sight, buried alive in the wreck of the galleon!</p>
<p>The party on the shore stared dumbly for one
minute, appalled by the horror of the tragedy, and
then Captain Blow leaped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on and dig!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t dig
like fury they&rsquo;ll smother to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the others followed him the intrepid captain
leaped down on the heap of sand where the boys
had last been seen and began to dig frantically. The
sand was loose and he sank down in it, but he dug
without heeding his own peril, and the others helped
him. Don&rsquo;s hand speedily worked loose from the
sand and they caught hold of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work right around his arm,&rdquo; cried the captain.
&ldquo;Be careful not to hit his head with your shovels.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>The scene was one of wildest confusion. By digging
with furious energy they got Don&rsquo;s head free
and only just in time. He was purple and fairly
clawed for air. They attempted to drag him loose,
but failed. He pushed the sand from his mouth
and spoke urgently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Ned!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s down around my
knees, somewhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor&rsquo;s face was white and he silently
kneeled beside Don&rsquo;s head and dug with all his
strength. Terry and Jim held the slippery sand back
as the two men shovelled it away, and in a few
seconds, which seemed like hours to them, one of
Ned&rsquo;s shoulders was uncovered. Dropping their
shovels the men wormed their hands beneath his
armpit and tore him loose from the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, water, senor,&rdquo; said Yappi, appearing beside
them with a canteen.</p>
<p>Ned was blue and unconscious, and they were
forced to dig the sand from his nose and mouth
before he could catch his breath. When he had
become conscious he drank some water, and Don
followed his example. They both were free to
breathe but were still buried and sinking, for the
sand was sifting down into the room below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fight has only just begun,&rdquo; said the captain,
grimly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get them out of here as
fast as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Then began a spirited battle between the men and
the sand, the human beings putting every ounce of
strength into the battle to keep their companions
from being engulfed again and the sand exerting
its power to entomb them once more, with a persistence
that was perfectly amazing. The muscles
of the friends ached, for they were tired from the
events of the day, but they knew it was a race
of life and death. They dug ceaselessly, throwing
sand as far away as possible, baffled and maddened
by the steady stream of the soil that returned to the
charge.</p>
<p>It grew steadily darker and at last the captain,
who had assumed charge of the rescue operations
spoke briefly to the professor. &ldquo;Tell your man to
light a big fire,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>When this was done they labored on, and after
an hour had gone by they were down as far as the
boys&rsquo; waists. They were working in a hollow that
had been made even more of a hole than normally
by the collapse of the deck, and so the sand proved
to be a persistent foe. As fast as they threw it
up it slid back, and there was no way to keep it
up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the captain, briskly. &ldquo;Tell your man
to back the horses down here, throw out a hawser,
grapple onto those lads, and tow &rsquo;em out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this had been put into the kind of language
that Yappi could understand he quickly ran the
horses into position, threw out a rope, and it was
passed under Don&rsquo;s armpits. Yappi sprang into the
saddle gave the horse the pressure of his heels, his
hand steady to check him at moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>The rope tightened, and the boys pushed Don&rsquo;s
body, with the result that he was hauled out of the
treacherous hole. Nothing was said at the time,
and Don made all haste to scramble to safety,
shaken by his experience. It was now an easier task
to get at Ned, for the freeing of Don had left a
bigger hole, and they tied him up securely. This
time the horse strained, the boy gritted his teeth
as the rope cut into his body, and the others pushed
with a will. With a final rush he came up and out
of the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted the captain, dropping his
shovel. &ldquo;The battle is won, mates! By tunket, let&rsquo;s
get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>They made haste to leave the place and then had
a happy reunion. The professor&rsquo;s lips moved as he
pressed Ned to him and Jim&rsquo;s eyes were not steady
when he hugged Don. Terry addressed the remains
of the wreck, while the mestizo patted the head of
the horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty smart, you old mud scow!&rdquo; the red-headed
boy said. &ldquo;That was the dragon&rsquo;s last stroke,
and he nearly made good on it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">NED TAKES A NEW OVERSEER</span></h2>
<p>They were all glad enough to rest that night
around the campfire. The muscles of the party were
stiff and sore, and Don and Ned declared that their
bodies ached from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got enough sand in me to build a new bunkhouse
at the ranch,&rdquo; Ned, declared.</p>
<p>They told their sensations as the wall of sand
closed over them, sensations by no means pleasant.
Smothering in sand was not an enviable means of
ending one&rsquo;s life, according to Ned, who had been
closest to it. Don had felt that he had a good
chance for his life, for he had been near the surface,
but his chief worriment had been for his
friend, whom he knew to be lower down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All things considered, I rather think we earned
that treasure,&rdquo; the professor remarked, and the
others agreed with him heartily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>Yappi could not be persuaded to go near the place
again. He was firm in the belief that an evil spirit
had tried to punish them for meddling with the gold
of dead men. During the time they had needed his
help he had been brave enough, but now that
there was nothing to fear he was more frightened
than he had ever been. More than all the others,
he looked forward to going home in the morning.</p>
<p>They slept the sleep of the utterly exhausted that
night and were late in getting up on the following
day. When all their things were packed and the
treasure which they had taken placed on the horses
they left the place and started for the ranch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That place isn&rsquo;t the best place in the world for
us,&rdquo; laughed Don, as they paused on a rise and
looked around. &ldquo;Jim and Terry were nearly killed
near there and then Ned and I got a sand bath.
That guardian dragon doesn&rsquo;t appear to like young
men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t object to the professor and
me,&rdquo; observed the captain, with a broad smile. &ldquo;We
both have beards and are more nearly his age!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>The journey back to the ranch was made without
incident and they were glad to arrive. After remaining
there for a day the professor and the captain
took the treasure and set out with it to the
coast, there to go to San Diego and claim legal
right to it. The boys accompanied them to Quito,
where Blow&rsquo;s own schooner, which was fortunately
lying at anchor, took them to their destination. The
boys left them in the town and returned to the
ranch.</p>
<p>There they passed several happy days, riding,
visiting the mines, going once or twice to visit the
senorita, and generally having a good time. Ned
went several times to the senorita&rsquo;s and Terry wisely
nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big doings pretty soon,&rdquo; he observed, wisely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Don. They were
out near the barn and Ned was not with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see. The young man is going over the
hill quite frequently now, and you wait and see if
something exciting doesn&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting married isn&rsquo;t exciting,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, my boy,&rdquo; drawled Terry, trying
to throw a lasso. &ldquo;Never been that way, myself!
Look at that for a throw, will you! Aimed it at
the fence post and got the corner of the barn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the professor and the captain returned they
reported success. Their claim was legal and they
had authority to recruit a gang of men to excavate
the ancient ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the end of the phantom galleon,&rdquo; observed
Don. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be a phantom any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pretty nearly joined the phantoms yourself,&rdquo;
Jim reminded him.</p>
<p>Terry&rsquo;s surmise regarding the state of affairs at
the Mercedes ranch turned out to be correct. In
a few days Ned announced that they were to be
married.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no use in allowing her to stay over
there and try to run that little ranch all by herself,&rdquo;
he said, as they sat in the living room one night.
&ldquo;So we are going to combine and form one big
ranch, after we are married. That will end all of
her troubles about getting help and overseers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Terry, dryly. &ldquo;You are doing it so
as to help her run her ranch. Funny way to get
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned made a pass at him and the red-headed boy
dodged. The professor smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the easiest way of saying it,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Ned wouldn&rsquo;t want you to suspect that he loves
the young lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned spoke about her difficulty in getting an overseer,&rdquo;
remarked Don. &ldquo;Another way to look at it
is that Ned himself is getting an overseer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;ll have to behave himself now,&rdquo; said the
captain, as they all laughed at Ned&rsquo;s red face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>In the days that followed an excavating crew
came down from San Francisco and went to work
on the wreck of the galleon. In a remarkably short
time it was unearthed and systematically cleaned
out. A treasure estimated in value at something
like fifty thousand dollars was found in the wreck,
a treasure that consisted of gold and silver plate,
gold coins, silver coins and several gold chains.
There was also some silk, but it had been spoiled.
The wreck itself, when uncovered, showed that it
had been burned to the water&rsquo;s edge before being
covered with the sands of the plains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when that is all divided, up, we&rsquo;ll have
plenty, each one of us,&rdquo; said the professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last my mother will get a few of the things
in life that she has really needed,&rdquo; said Terry, to
whom the fortune meant most.</p>
<p>Not long after that there was a simple wedding in
the Scott ranch. A minister came to the ranch from
Quito and Ned and the senorita were married in
the living room of the ranch which was now to be
her home. Ned was quietly happy and the senorita
brilliantly so. All the lonely years of living alone
were now over, and she looked forward to a life of
happiness with the American boy whose simple
manliness had always appealed to her. Don was
Ned&rsquo;s best man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;By golly,&rdquo; said Terry, when it was all over. &ldquo;If
getting married makes you feel as happy as Ned and
his lady friend looked, I think I&rsquo;ll try it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be fine, Terry,&rdquo; responded Jim. &ldquo;By the
way, who is the lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked the red-headed boy, blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the lady that will look so happy when
you marry her?&rdquo; Jim answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;You have
to have a lady friend, don&rsquo;t you? I hadn&rsquo;t thought
of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better give it some thought,&rdquo; retorted
Don. &ldquo;Most people have one when they get married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few more days the boys prepared to return
home, along with the professor, who was eager
to return to his classes in school. The boys were
looking forward to their second year at Woodcrest,
to the study and the sports of the coming season.
Captain Blow left them a few days earlier, expressing
his pleasure at having met them once more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I fall in with you Mercer boys again
sometime,&rdquo; he said, as he shook hands at the dock.
&ldquo;I always have a barrel of fun when I&rsquo;m with you.
Makes me young again. If you ever sail past old
Mystery Island, think of me, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days later they all said goodbye to the new
Mr. and Mrs. Scott, wishing them well and promising
to come and see them if they were ever in that
part of the world again. Before long they were
back in San Francisco and on the train, bound for
home and school. Terry was with them, having had
&ldquo;Jumpiter&rdquo; shipped by rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Don, as they rolled past long
fields of grain. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the end of one of the best
vacations we ever had. Now we&rsquo;ll go back to
school, to settle down and take things easy for a
change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if Don could have seen the events that awaited
them in the coming school term in the form of a
baffling mystery he would not have been so sure that
they would settle down. In the next volume, entitled
<span class="sc">The Mercer Boys&rsquo; Mystery Case</span>, or the
&rsquo;13 <span class="sc">Class Trophy Riddle</span> the exciting things which
befell them will be related.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
